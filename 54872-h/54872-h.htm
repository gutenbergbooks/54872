<div><h1>PREFACE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The otter has long seemed to me worthy of
serious attention, if only for the successful
struggle it has waged against those exterminating
agencies under which the badger, the wildcat,
the polecat and the marten have all but
succumbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its survival throughout Great Britain is due,
partly to its endurance and resources when
hunted, partly to qualities and habits which
differentiate it from the other creatures of the
wild. Its scent, for instance, unlike that of fox
or badger, to which every tike and lurcher will
stoop, is noticed by few dogs save hounds that
have been trained to own it; and the outlawed
beast thus gains a certain immunity from destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the otter is a great wanderer, who not
only traverses long stretches of coast and follows
streams and rivers to their source, but crosses
hills and even mountains to reach its fishing-grounds.
It has been known to travel fifteen
miles in a night, and not infrequently the holts
where it lies up during the day are ten or twelve
miles apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way to its quarters it will linger to
fish or hunt, and the remains of eel, salmon,
pike, rabbit, moorhen or wild-duck mark the
scene of the midnight feast. But no matter
how much it may leave uneaten the otter never
returns to a kill, and so escapes the traps with
which gamekeeper or water-bailiff is sure to ring
the ground about it. Unlike its congener the
polecat, the otter does not hoard food; unless the
caches of frogs occasionally found in marshes
are its work, and not that of the heron as is
generally supposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However that may be it is certain that it does
not hibernate, but is abroad night after night
the whole year round. Indeed, as often as not,
the female produces her young in the depth of
winter, and indefatigable forager though she is,
must often be sore pressed to provide food for
her litter. At times the conditions are too
severe, and a tragedy ensues. At Mullyon, in
Mount’s Bay, one bitterly cold December, when
the Poldhu stream was frozen and the sea too
rough and discoloured for the otter to fish, the
poor creature in her extremity crept into a
bungalow in the course of erection, and was there
found curled up dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems to me a matter for regret that such
an interesting beast is not better known; and
the present narrative is an attempt to portray it
amidst the wild surroundings that are so congenial
to its shy nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The critical reader will perhaps wonder at the
daring that essays to interpret the workings of
the most subtle of animal brains, but I submit
that the inferences are, for the most part, of a
very safe character; and modest as they are, they
would not have been adventured on, had it not
been for my long familiarity with the ways and
habits of a creature that is by general consent
the most mysterious and inscrutable of our
fauna, for the incidents described embody the
gleanings of a lifetime of observation and inquiry.
It will be noted that I agree with those who hold
that in pursuit of fish the otter is guided wholly
by sight, though it may well be that the extraordinary
powers of scent which enable the creature
to detect the presence of fish in a stream or pond
by sniffing the surface are called into play during
immersion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of the otter is, I believe, now told
at any length for the first time; and my hope is
to bring about a wider and deeper interest in
the animal, and be the means of removing some
of the prejudice which unjustly attaches to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I take this opportunity of thanking the Duchess
of Bedford and Mr. J. G. Millais for their
courtesy in allowing me the use of most valuable
illustrations.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:2em;font-weight:bold;'>THE LIFE STORY OF AN OTTER</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>IN THE NURSERY</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in a morass in a hollow of the foothills
that he was littered. His mother chose this inaccessible
spot for the security it promised to her
helpless young. In the heart of the <a id='quag1'></a>quagmire
they would be safe, she thought, from floods and—what
was still more important to her—from
man. She could not find a hover quite to her
liking, but in lack of a better, she chose a ledge
where, in an angle of the stream that drained the
bog, the bank furnished a screen from the biting
wind which blew up the valley and soughed over
the uplands. After enlarging the ledge into a
shelf, she shaped the excavation for the nest,
which she fashioned out of dead rushes and
withered grasses, and which she lined with the
softest products that Nature offered her—tattered
reed-plumes and seed-down of the bulrush. Night
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
after night she ransacked the waste in quest of
these rare spoils, lest the rude structure should be
wanting in cosiness for the cubs which, even before
it was quite finished, were deposited in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were only two to share her affection—the
intense affection of the hunted creature for
its offspring. The dread of being reft of them
haunted her from their birth, but happily the
mites themselves knew no fear, knew nothing
but the warm, furry mother who fondled and
suckled them. Whelps and dam were as one,
for she seldom left them save to get food; and
this she sought and devoured with feverish
energy, that she might the sooner return to them.
She foraged sometimes, it is true, in the morass
itself; but usually she had to go to the river at
the foot of the long, undulating slope, and though
the inconvenience of having the fishing-ground so
far away was often borne in upon her, she put up
with it, and never for a moment thought of
moving the cubs from the safe keeping of the bog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the grey skies, the rain and the sleet of
January, few more cheerless scenes could be
found than the moorland and the morass within
it; yet there in the hollowed bank the otter and
the wee, blind, downy-coated creatures she had
entrusted to the chill mercies of midwinter, lay
nestled in the snuggest of hovers. And the
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
grim season would relent at times, breaking into
bright days when the sun bestowed its warmth
on the cold, sodden earth. Then the morass and
all the hills about it were bathed in the glow,
and the swollen stream, visible over the edge of
the nest, glistened like silver. Quick to accept
Nature’s bounty for the winterlings, the otter,
when satisfied that no eye observed her, took
them between her lips, carried them from the
gloomy hover, and laid them on a tussock which
screened her where she crouched, ready to
protect them. There the cubs stretched themselves
and basked with quiet content in the
health-giving rays. But when the sun passed
behind the clouds, they would complain at the
withdrawal of the warmth, and raise their blinking
eyes to the sky as if protesting to a second
mother against such unfeeling treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For before this they had opened their eyes—black,
restless eyes, like those which kept constant
watch and ward over their safety. The otter, of
course, managed to get a little sleep, but it was
of the lightest. At the startled note of a bird, or
even the sudden rustling of the reeds when a gust
shook them, her head would pop up from the
grasses concealing her; and she generally made a
keen inspection of the sky-line and of the ground
within her ken before she lay down again and
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
snatched another forty winks. But as morning
after morning passed without intrusion of aught
to warrant her suspicions, her vigilance gradually
relaxed; and one noon, when she was very weary
from the night’s foraging, she curled up and fell
sound asleep at her post.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst she slept, a <a id='buzz1'></a>buzzard, mewing as he
quartered the ground beneath, espied the cubs,
and thinking they were at his mercy, stooped to
seize the easy prey. He was about to lay hold
of the smaller cub when the otter, awakened by
the strange cry, rose from her hiding-place and
confronted him. At sight of her the bird, taken
aback, thought only of escape, but the mother
was bent on avenging the attempted wrong.
Quick as lightning she sprang at him, and, had
not the hummock given way beneath her, she
must have gripped him despite the frantic down-strokes
of the big wings which lifted him well
beyond her second leap. Her fierce eyes and
bristling hair made her terrible to behold as she
stood watching the marauder’s retreat, and hissing
the while like a fury. Then, as if fearful that the
fray had attracted attention, she took her eyes off
the bird and scrutinized the approaches to the
morass before removing the cubs to the nest, where
she stilled their complaints by fondling them until
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
they fell asleep and forgot their sunny couch on
the grass. The incident troubled the otter so
greatly that, resisting all their importunities, she
never again exposed them to the risk of capture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To break the monotony of the hover, the cubs,
as their limbs grew stronger, would, in the
intervals of sleep, clamber to the wide parapet of
the nest and take note of the things that moved
within their narrow field: of trembling grasses,
of the bramble spray that moved to and fro in
the current, of the reeds that nodded in the wind,
and, above all, of the creatures that visited the
stream to feed or quench their thirst. They
watched every step taken by the snipe, every
thrust of his long bill; they regarded with
wonder the gay kingfisher that perched on their
ledge and fished in their pool; they were moved
to the keenest curiosity by the old dog-fox, who
stole from the reeds to drink and set their young
nostrils working with his strong scent. When
sure of their footing, with pads outstretched and
every webbed toe expanded they advanced to
the very edge of the nest, pushed their dusky
grey heads through the grassy curtain, and looked
down at the eddy gurgling below, contemplating
the element in which their lives would be spent
and whose every change they were to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
They resembled kittens more than any other
young creatures, the difference lying in their
tiny ears and shy, wild eyes. But, suggestive of
fear as was their look, they were not as yet conscious
of the danger besetting them, even when
able to scramble up the bank and sprawl about
the bog. Thither the otter led them in all
weathers, and it was for this duty that she
hurried back to them the instant she had done
foraging. Now and again the scarcity of prey
or the difficulty of securing it would detain her
far into the night and sorely tax the patience of
the cubs, eager for her return. In the intervals
of listening they would pace round the now
dishevelled nest, increasing their speed as the
hours passed without sign of her. At length
the shrill whistle, heard even above the storm
or downpour, would reach them, and set them
dancing with delight. Two furry heads and little
red tongues greeted the panting mother as soon
as her feet rested on the ledge, and the next
instant the capering creatures followed her as
she led to the gambolling-ground beyond the
great reed-bed. There they frolicked to their
heart’s content through the hours of darkness,
and even after sun-up when thick fog shrouded
the morass. On reaching the nest the otter
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
suckled them to sleep, and, lying between them
and the mouth of the holt, as was her invariable
custom, shielded them from cold and danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were happy days for the dam, but owing
to the wilfulness of the male cub they did not
last long. He had taken it into his head that he
was big enough to go out alone, and one night
out he ventured. He was more than half-way
to the reed-bed when his mother found him.
This first demonstration of independence caused
her little concern, but she was almost beside
herself with anxiety when, two days later, he
made an attempt to sally out in broad daylight,
and all but succeeded in getting away. He was
nearly over the bank when she pulled him back
by the tail and gave him a sharp nip by way of
punishment. The very next day the incorrigible
fellow got even farther away; but she discovered
his absence before he had got beyond the tussocks,
fetched him back, and bit him severely as
she laid him down in the nest. Thus disobedience
brought unhappiness into the hover, and the
cub, shrinking from the mother he deemed cruel,
shuffled to the inmost corner, where fibrous roots
protruded from the low roof, and there licked his
bruises in morose isolation.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Aware now of his rashness, the otter dared
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
not leave the nest by day as she had occasionally
done before. One noon, however, impelled by
her own hunger and the cubs’ piteous entreaties
for food, she put aside her apprehensions and
stole out, leaving them to their own devices. As
quickly as her pads could carry her, she made
her way down the hill along the rents that fissured
the peaty ground, dived across the swollen
pool in the hollow below, dashed over the sward
beyond some alders, and gained the wood and
the river unobserved. The river was bank-high
and much discoloured, but after a long quest she
came on an eel abroad in the flood. Landing
under some bushes on the far side, she devoured
half the fish, and then, without a moment’s
delay, slipped into the river and floated down
with the current. At a rapid pace she rounded
bend after bend, came ashore at a backwater,
leapt some felled trees, and regained the bog
by the same hidden ways. To her dismay she
found, as she had feared, the nest deserted and
cold. In great distress she set out to fetch the
truants home. She followed their trail to the
reed-bed, through which she dashed like a thing
demented, and came upon her two cubs playing
in the open as fearlessly as only tame creatures
may play. On sighting their mother, the
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
runaways, instead of slinking off guilt-stricken,
rushed at the full speed of their ungainly
limbs to meet her, and tried by winning antics
to induce her to join in their midday romp.
Gladly as she would have complied, her response
was to drag them into cover, take the smaller
cub in her mouth, carry it to the nest, and
return for the ringleader, who squealed with
rage until soundly ducked in the pool below the
hover. The dark-pelted creature was a conspicuous
object as she splashed across the exposed
spaces; but, as good fortune would have it, both
she and the cubs escaped the observation of the
<a id='keep1'></a>keeper who was occasionally to be seen on the
hills overlooking the morass. Still, the poor outlaw
had been taught a sharp lesson, and resolved
never again on any pretext to leave the cubs by day.
So greatly was she perturbed by their escapade
that she even longed for the moment when fear
should awaken in them and whisper its monitions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, she looked forward with impatience
to the night when they would be able to follow
her afield and learn the many lessons she was
anxious to teach them; and in order to hasten
the time, she devoted every hour she could spare
to sharing their frolics, so that they might develop
rapidly.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>EARLY TRAINING</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the cubs were a little over eight weeks
old, their mother resolved to take them to the
pool and teach them to swim; so one starry
night at setting-out time she led the young
creatures—overjoyed, as their excited antics
showed, at this new departure—to the brow of
the rising ground, till then the boundary of their
narrow world. There, whilst the otter stood and
reconnoitred, the eyes of the cubs wandered
wonderingly from slope and rushy hollow to
the woods across the ravine, where a vixen was
squalling. As no danger threatened, dam and
whelps made for the faintly silvered pool lying
so still and silent in contrast with the river that
ran brawling along its boulder-strewn channel.
On reaching it the mother swam slowly out,
turning her head the while as if to invite the
cubs to follow her, landed on the islet and, in
order to work on their feelings and draw them
across the water, hid herself amongst the withered
sedge. This was not without its effect, as the
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
cries of the cubs showed; yet, distressed though
they were at the separation, they were afraid to
commit themselves to the pool and try to join
her. Thereupon the otter swam back to within
a few feet of the foreland where the shrinking
creatures stood and, wheeling slowly, returned
again to the islet, calling as she went.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='cubs1'></a>This she did many times, employing every
wile she knew to coax them after her; but
all in vain. For three nights, despite all her
pains, she failed to tempt them beyond the
shallows. At last, just when she was about to
put them out of their depth, the smaller cub
overcame its hesitation, waded till it lost foothold,
then swam bravely across, landed with a
little wriggling jump, and sent the spray flying
from every silky hair along the fourteen inches
of its length, as it shook itself before rolling on
the sedge to dry its coat more thoroughly. The
male cub, who had watched her every movement,
was now beside himself at being left alone, and
after running for some time up and down the
bank, uttering the most piteous plaints, followed
the others across and dried his fur as his sister
had done. Presently they all swam back to the
foreland. Before returning to the hover, they
crossed and recrossed four times more; and once
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
even, in the absence of the otter, who was away
foraging, the cubs crossed alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this night their fear of the water abated,
and soon, with scarce a ripple to mark their
smooth progress, they were able to accompany
their proud mother in her circlings round and
round the pool. When the smaller cub tired,
the otter slackened her pace, sank very low, took
it on her back, and carried it to the shallows;
but the male cub always had to take care of
himself. The subsequent improvement was very
rapid, and at the end of a week so fond did they
become of the water that when released from
the hover they scurried to the pool in advance
of their mother, stumbling and falling as they
ran in their eagerness to reach it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being full of the young creature’s love of
‘hide-and-seek,’ they often concealed themselves
before she came up. On hearing her approach,
they drew their heads beneath the surface until
only their nostrils showed and, though thrilling
with excitement, kept as motionless as the alder
snags about them until discovered. Then mother
and cubs joined in play, disporting themselves at
times on the surface, but more often in the
depths. Presently they would rise, locked
together as if in deadly struggle, and roll over
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
and over like a water-logged ball in a current.
All at once, and frequently whilst immersed,
they would break up, land, and make the circuit
of the banks, passing one another as though they
were utter strangers, and then suddenly, as if by
signal, take to the water again and resume their
mimic warfare. Once whilst they were thus
engaged the whistle of an otter reached them
from the river. In a twinkling they stayed their
gambols, and, floating side by side, listened until
the call grew faint as the traveller passed up the
valley; then they fell again to their romps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wonderful ease and grace marked their
movements in the pool, and still more in the
streams and eddies of the river, to which the
otter lost no time in taking them. They spent
hours shooting the rapids below the salmon
pool, landing at the end of the long run where
the rush of water loses its force, and regaining
the head of the current by climbing the rocky
bank. So attractive did this diversion prove
that but for their mother’s restraint the eager
creatures would have left the nest for the river
long before it was safe to be abroad. Once,
indeed, overborne by their importunities, she so
far yielded as to lead them out before the afterglow
had paled; but this concession only made
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
them more exacting. On the morrow they
would have her release them the moment the
sun dipped below the crest and the shadow of the
upland fell on the morass. But she turned a
deaf ear to their entreaties and, when they
became insubordinate and attempted to force a
way past her, punished them with many sharp
nips and kept them back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was also much troubled at this time by
their refusal to eat the fish with which she had
been doing her best to tempt them. It mattered
not whether she offered them samlet, trout, or
eel, they turned from all alike, and it seemed as
if they would never be brought to touch any.
Nevertheless she persisted, till one night, on
the bank of the deep pool below the rapids, the
male cub took a trout from her mouth, and the
next night, just before dawn, his sister did the
same. Their aversion to solid food once overcome,
they would chatter over the new diet as
if to testify to the pleasure they found in the
exercise of their newly acquired taste, or even
hiss angrily when their savage passions were
stirred by the wriggling or quivering of the fish
in their grip. They held the prey between the
fore-paws, slicing off delicate morsels with their
pearly teeth, and champing them fine before
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
swallowing. Most remarkable was the way they
set about eating two of the fish their mother
provided for them. With the trout they began
at the head, but in the case of the eel they
attacked the part below the vent, leaving the
upper portion untouched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This fish diet produced a most significant
change: the cubs became fierce, and at the same
time fearful. No longer was any restraint needed
to keep them to the nest or to the holts in the
river-banks, where they occasionally lay; no
longer had the mother any difficulty in getting
them to obey the dawn-cry and follow whither
she led. Henceforth the sense of dread lay on
their lives like a shadow and deepened with
their development. It was seen in their readiness
to crouch or make for the water at any
strange sound, in their suspicion of any strange
object. A bottle left on the bank by the water-bailiff
caused them to take a wide détour, and the
snapping of a stick under the foot of a lumbering
<a id='bad1'></a>badger nearly frightened these noiseless movers
out of their wits. Once a thunderstorm terrified
them with its vivid flashes, and one day even a
brilliant rainbow was a source of alarm, until
their mother awoke and showed no concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These trifling scares were followed towards the
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
close of March by an incident they never forgot—an
incident which caused the otter even greater
consternation than it caused the cubs. It happened
late one afternoon. The male cub had
awakened from his second sleep and, with head
resting on his mother’s flank, sat looking at the
light fade over the wind-swept morass. During
a lull an unaccountable rustling in the reeds
caught his ears and brought him to his feet.
The startled movement aroused his mother and
sister, and in a trice all three otters were watching
from behind the grass screen for a sight of
the noisy intruder. The next instant they saw
a <a id='fox1'></a>fox, bedraggled almost beyond recognition,
stagger from the reeds, drop from the bank
to the stream, lap, raise his head and listen,
lap again, then toil with bog-stained body and
sodden brush up the opposite bank and pass from
view. He could not have got far beyond the
river, for which he seemed to be heading, before
a hound came in sight, then two more, followed
almost immediately by the body of the pack,
which poured over the brow of the upland and
streamed down a gully towards the morass.
Soon they had disappeared, but whine after
whine reached the otters’ ears, mingled with the
crashing of the brake as the pack approached
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
the stream and swept by full in their view.
Some minutes later two yapping, bog-stained
<a id='terr1'></a>terriers crossed, and then the morass resumed
its wonted calm. All this the otters had
watched, hissing through their bared teeth, eyes
starting from their sockets, and hair bristling
erect on their thick necks: even when all
was quiet again a great dread still possessed
them. Their feral nature had been stirred to
the depths, and they listened and listened,
though no sound reached them save a faint toot
of the horn. Setting-out time came and went,
but the otters did not stir, till at length, taking
heart from the owls, who filled the wood with
their wild hooting, they stole down to the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The otter fished, but not a moment was given
to gambolling, and long ere the woodman’s
bantam heralded the day the scared creatures
sought harbourage in the branches of a fallen
pine whose top lay half immersed in the river.
Hidden amidst the flotsam caught by the boughs,
with the deep pool just below them, they felt
safe, and at length slept as soundly as they had
done in the morass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They repaired to the same hover the next day
and the day following. In their waking hours
they would watch the eddying water and rising
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
trout, and at times cast a glance at the belt
of timber beyond, as if attracted by the crimson
blossom of the elms. Not only did the
flowering of forest tree tell of the passing of
winter, but green shoots of flag and reed shyly
whispered the same story, and wild daffodils in
glade and dell proclaimed it. A <a id='gold'></a>gold-crest in
the tall fir had begun laying her tiny freckled
eggs; a throstle on the lone poplar by the pool
sang to his mate guarding her turquoise treasures
by the river’s bank, while the <a id='rave1'></a>ravens up the face
of the cliff were already busy feeding their young.
Day by day, as the sun grew stronger and the
west wind blew, the sycamores unfolded their
fresh green leaves, and soon, the woodland over,
all the buds, responsive to the quickened underworld,
opened to greet the <a id='spring'></a>spring.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of a hot day, when every furry
wildling had felt its coat a burden, and longed
for sundown and the drinking-place, the otter,
who had been gradually extending her nocturnal
rambles, took the cubs three miles down the
river to a point where a part of the water is
diverted into a tranquil mill-stream. Along its
bank she brought them to the gate leading to
the mill-yard, where all three stood and listened
momentarily to the croaking of the frogs in the
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
meadow beyond. Then they slipped under the
low bar, crossed the yard, skirted the house, and
hurried towards the ditch from which the noise
proceeded. The croaking ceased on their approach,
and before the otter entered the water
every frog had sought a hiding-place at the
bottom. The otter had scarcely dived before
she was out again with <a id='frog1'></a>two frogs in her mouth.
These she skinned and gave to the cubs. Finding
the morsel toothsome, and learning that
if they wanted more they must fish for themselves,
they joined in the easy pursuit, and for
the first time in their lives satisfied their hunger
with prey of their own taking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, they quarrelled like little tigers over a
frog, of which each claimed possession, and so
loud a chattering did they make that the miller
got out of bed and opened his window to learn
the cause of the disturbance. The creak of the
sash silenced and alarmed them, and the next
instant they and their mother were heading for
the river at their best speed. An hour later
the raiders started to return home by a route
that took them wide of the mill where the
danger lurked, thus reaching the morass without
mishap; and the otter soon fell asleep, but
the cubs lay awake thinking of an incident of
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
the night. It was not the frogs that occupied
their thoughts, not the bare yard or the fearsome
trail across it, but the night-capped monster
whom they still pictured as he appeared at the
window.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>THE FIRST TREK</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a single night was given up to frogging
after the cubs had learnt to skin their prey.
Forthwith the little mother, anxious to make the
best of their time, led them to the moorland
waters of one of the tributary streams to <a id='cubs2'></a>teach
them to fish. There she had taken her first litter
for their earliest lessons, and now, as then, she
made for the pool above the old two-arched
bridge, which she still thought most suited for
a starting-point. To reach the fishing-ground
betimes, she left the morass with the first shades
of night and, crossing the river near the fallen
pine, struck across country towards her destination.
Her path led through the woodland to a
waste of furze, and this to the high moorland
which the stream serves to drain. <a id='trek1'></a>Once on the
heathery tableland, otter and cubs advanced at
a rapid pace, and presently hit the track to
the bridge, which they followed, leaving their
footprints here and there on the margin of the
shrunken puddles. When nearly abreast of the
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
Giant’s Quoits, first the otter and then the cubs
caught the voice of the stream. The low
murmur was almost lost in the sigh of the night
wind, but grew louder and louder, till soon
chattering run and plashing cascade appeared in
the dip below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching the pool, the otter entered the
water with the cubs at her side, dived, and drove
the <a id='trout'></a>trout to the shelter of the banks. Thereupon
the cubs, who saw where the fish had fled, fell to
drawing the hovers, thrusting their flat heads
into hole and crevice as far as they could reach.
But the trout had found secure recesses, and
though a few felt the lips of the otters, they
could not be seized, and all but one escaped.
In the pool at the bend, however, where the
bank, hollowed though it is, affords poor shelter,
three were taken. Then the captors, two on the
gravel, the other on a mid-stream boulder, lay
at full length and ate their prey, munching
ravenously. The otter seemed to have set aside
her fears since reaching the moor, for never once
did she trouble to listen or even to scan the
sable waste around her. All her thoughts were
for the cubs, whom she led from pool to pool,
aiding them until they began to fish for themselves;
then she stood aside and watched them.
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
Trout after trout they caught and devoured
along the winding reaches leading to the long,
sullen pool in the midst of the moor, where the
mother, elated by their success, joined merrily in
their gambols, which were kept up until past the
usual hovering-time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day was on them when they landed and
sought the most inviting <a id='couch1'></a>couches the bank
offered. First the cubs wormed themselves out
of sight, then the otter; and so effectually were
all three concealed amongst the rocks and
heather that a <a id='kest'></a>kestrel, hovering over the spot,
failed to get a glimpse of their brown forms,
and flew on without a suspicion of their presence.
Nevertheless, the open bank, though it had a
marshy tract on one side and a deep pool on the
other, was an insecure lodging, so that it was
only because the moorland afforded no better
that they returned thither on the morrow. After
that the otter, jealous for the cubs’ safety, made
some five miles downstream, where the holts
amongst the roots of withy and alder were strong
and sheltered from the rain that had rendered
the upland hovers so uncomfortable on the
second day. It is true the trout were scarce,
but this mattered little to the otters, <a id='eels1'></a>for eels,
their favourite prey, were abundant. Amongst
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
them was a very large one which, on being
gripped by the male cub, coiled itself round his
neck and threatened to strangle him. In this
predicament the otter, after a short struggle,
made for the bank and rolled amongst the fern
and bramble to free himself of his antagonist.
Finding this of no avail, he shifted his grip
to a point nearer the head and, using the
terrible force of his jaws, broke the back of the
eel, and so got rid of it. This fish had been
captured in the shallows, but for the most part
the eels were only to be had by turning over the
big stones under which they darted at sight of
their pursuers. The young otters eagerly joined
their mother in dislodging their prey and catching
them when they bolted. The swiftness of
the animals in this pursuit was amazing, and
no less so the quick turning movements in
which rudder and fore-paw were both brought
into play. Indeed the long, lissom, tapering
creatures resembled huge eels, and might have
been mistaken for eels but for the bubbles
which rose to the surface and marked their
course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The otters kept to this part of the stream for
nearly a week—that is, until the freshet which
had caused the run of eels subsided, and rendered
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
a change of quarters necessary. They then
betook themselves to the main tributary on the
opposite bank, three miles above the morass; but
finding that some other otters had disturbed the
water in front, they pressed on, and at length
came up with them where the stream winds
sluggishly through a swampy bottom. Two were
fishing in the stream, the rest in the marsh; but
presently the whole party came into view, and as
they trotted along the bank were seen to be four
well-grown cubs with their dam, old and slightly
grizzled. They all went on in company, but as
day approached drew only the best pools, and
gave up fishing altogether after striking the trail
of the <a id='moorm1'></a>moorman who had forded the stream at
sundown. Indeed on finding the dreaded taint
of man there was quite a stir amongst them,
especially amongst the cubs, who kept close
alongside their mothers, and wondered where
harbourage was to be found on the seemingly
bare upland to which they were being led. At
length the scared creatures sighted the weedy
lakelet where the stream rises and, just as the
rim of the sun showed gained the shelter of the
<a id='reed1'></a>reeds that fringed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day proved intensely hot and still, with
not a breath to ripple the surface or freshen the
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
stifling air of the brake where the otters lay
panting until dusk fell and allowed them to
quench their tormenting thirst without fear of
detection. Then, leaving their quarters, the two
families travelled together till, after crossing two
naked hills, they came to a rushy flat, lined with
sour watercourses, where the trail forked, and
there they parted company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The otter was bound for the head-waters of
the tributary nearest the source of the river, and
soon after midnight reached the boggy gathering
ground with its network of runnels and chain of
pools in which she and the cubs fished until the
stars began to pale. Then the hunters in single
file made along the slender stream for the basin
below the fall, sporting together till the sun rose
over the distant sea and flooded the upland with
its beams. The otter, usually observant of the
first signs of dawn, seemed not to heed the golden
light, even when the cubs began to grow uneasy
and to shoot reproachful glances at her for keeping
them abroad at so late an hour. But she
needed not to be reminded of her duty. She
knew they ran no risk in that untrodden spot;
indeed on leaving the pool she stood on the
bank to gaze across the dew-spangled waste
and then at the gilded crags of <a id='lone1'></a>Lone Tarn,
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
before at length withdrawing to a clitter some
half-mile down the stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There the dark recesses of the pile of rocks
proved a welcome retreat to the cubs, and with
the music of the waters for a lullaby they soon
fell asleep. They hovered there again on the
morrow; after which they continued on their
journey laying up under the bank of the wide
pool where the stream joins the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At setting-out time the otter seemed half-minded
to follow the river to its source, for she
kept looking towards the lone hill where it rises;
but presently—the lowness of the water probably
weighing with her—she decided to go downstream,
summoned her cubs and trotted across
the bend to the head of the long rapids, where
they entered the water and drifted with the
current. At dawn they sought a <a id='rabb'></a>rabbit-burrow
on the river-bank so near the woods that the
cubs, who lay by the mouth of one of the holes,
could hear the pigeons cooing. The retreat was
safe and very dry, and would have left little to
desire if the rabbits had taken no notice. But
the timid creatures, thoroughly alarmed at the
presence of the otters, stamped almost without
intermission and prevented their uninvited
guests from sleeping. At noon the otter,
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
annoyed beyond endurance, rose and chased the
rabbits along the tunnels; but this only made
them worse. After that the drumming was kept
up in every level, and made the visitors long for
night. So at early dusk, after another raid on
the persecutors, the otters slid down the bank
into the water and let the stream take them
along reach after reach until they were far into
the wood. All the way they never ceased to
scan the banks; they seemed to suspect an enemy
behind every tree, but surely without sufficient
cause. At one spot the <a id='fox2'></a>green eyes of a fox
watched them as they passed, otherwise they
floated along unnoticed save by the bats flitting
up and down the dark spaces beneath the overhanging
boughs. On reaching the fallen pine
they began to fish, and so continued all the way
to the salmon pool, where they sported till dawn
drove them again to the morass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the weeks that followed they kept to
the neighbourhood of the old nursery, lying up
for the most part under rocks and tree-roots at
the water’s edge, but occasionally in the morass
itself. It was whilst couching there that the
otter, alarmed by the continued fall of the river
and the exposure of the mouths of the strongest
hovers, suddenly resolved to make for the tidal
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
waters, whose holts are unaffected by droughts,
and where she could teach the cubs many new
lessons. She first thought of going down the
river to the estuary, but changed her plans almost
at the last moment and determined to make for
a creek where she had had good fishing with her
mate, the father of the cubs. The destination
was two good marches distant, but she knew a
stronghold by the way where they could lodge,
and from which they could easily reach the creek
on the following night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her anxiety to gain this refuge before dawn,
she left her couch in the reed-bed at early dusk
and, full of her purpose, made for the old hover
where the cubs always slept when in the morass.
Hearing the faint rustle of the herbage as she
approached, the quick-eared creatures left the
nest, and when she came up, fell into their place
at her side. <a id='trek2'></a>Leading past the pool to the river,
she crossed it and headed towards the <a id='wood1'></a>woodman’s
cottage. The rapid pace at which the animals
travelled soon brought them within sight of the
low, thatched building beneath its sheltering oak,
but as nothing stirred they passed close to the
garden fence and into the gloom of the pines
beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A happier little band of nomads could not be
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
found than the otter and her cubs, quite unsuspicious
of danger, though they were running
straight into its jaws. At a sudden turn of the
mossy track where rocks contract the way they
came face to face with Venom, the woodman’s
<a id='terr2'></a>terrier. Venom was returning from a badgers’
sett which he visited whenever he could slip away
unobserved, and his begrimed and bloodstained
condition told how severe had been the fray
between him and one of the badgers. He looked
a woebegone mongrel as he limped along on
three legs; but the instant he found himself face
to face with the strangers he forgot his fatigue
and flew at the otter’s throat with a fury that
threatened to make short work of her. He soon
discovered, however, that he had caught a
Tartar. The shaking he gave her had little
other result than further to exhaust himself,
while the otter began punishing him about the
face and shoulders, making her teeth meet at
every bite. Besides inflicting severe wounds, she
was actually pushing the dog back, and after a
prolonged tussle was clear of the rocks and close
to a fallen tree from which the terrified cubs
were watching the fray. Another scrimmage
here took place, even longer and fiercer than
the first: then the dog hesitated to renew the
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
fight and stood on the defensive. Thereupon
the otter, whose one thought was escape, joined
the cubs and made off. The sight of their
retreat was, however, more than Venom could
stand, and they had scarcely disappeared before
he was in pursuit. On overtaking them, he laid
hold of the male cub, probably mistaking him
for his mother. With a viciousness that belied
his cubhood, the young dog-otter closed with his
first assailant, and would have made a brave fight
had he been allowed to conduct it alone. But
he was not. <a id='fight1'></a>Like a tiger the mother fell on the
terrier, and it looked as if the dog would be cut
to pieces. His one thought, however, was to
destroy the vermin, and instead of drawing off as
he might have done at the foot of the steep slope,
down which they fell rather than rolled, he
actually closed again, fought to the edge of the
pool there, even held on to the otter when she
dived, and kept his hold until his lungs were
exhausted. Then he let go, but on coming to
the surface he did not make for the bank. He
swam round and round, looking for his enemy,
and only when he had lost hope of viewing her
again did he land at last. On being freed from
his grip, the otter had made her way close along
the bottom to the upper end of the pool, where
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
the cubs were waiting for her among some rushes.
From their shelter mother and cubs now watched
the movements of their puzzled foe, who began
examining the banks of the pool. When he came
near, they sank almost out of sight, their nostrils
alone showing, and so remained until he had time
to pass; then the otter raised her head to reconnoitre.
Once as she did so she found the terrier
standing within a few yards, but looking so
intently in another direction that he failed to
sight her; whereupon she sank again as noiselessly
as she had risen, not leaving even her nostrils
exposed. A score of times, at least, did the dog
make the circuit of the pool; and had he been
able to scent the otter—a thing which but few
dogs can do—he must at least have driven them
from their shelter, and possibly from the pool, for
it was very small. Yet, insensible though he
was to the scent, he was so convinced the animals
were there that, after departing, he actually came
back and looked again before taking himself off
for good and leaving the otters free to resume
their interrupted march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three hours they had been detained, and
now, hurry as they might, it was impossible to
reach the cairn before daybreak. Indeed, they
were yet two miles away when the ridges above
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
them were touched by the risen sun. To add to
their troubles a <a id='mag'></a>magpie espied them, and though
they were strange to him as to the terrier, he
knew they were nightlings with no right to be
abroad after sunrise, and mobbed them as he
would have mobbed a leash of foxes. Under
the brambles and osmunda ferns they were
hidden from the pest, but in the open he had
them at his mercy and, now fluttering just
beyond their reach, now hopping from branch
to branch of rowan or alder or wild-cherry,
he annoyed them with impunity. At last they
came to the foot of the slope at the head of the
ravine threaded the furze as fast as their pads
could carry them, reached the pile of rocks, and
one by one disappeared through the narrow
crevice near its base. The magpie, however,
instead of flying off, perched on the pinnacle of
the cairn and, with his head knowingly cocked
on one side, watched for their reappearance.
Long, long he waited, but as the creatures made
no sign, he tired, took wing, flew down the
ravine past the precipice where the <a id='rave2'></a>ravens had
their nest, and regained the wood of which he
was so vigilant a sentinel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The persecuted beasts soon forgot the magpie,
but the terrier had left a deeper memory, and all
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
three were long in falling asleep. The otter,
indeed, was still awake at noon, when a <a id='weas'></a>weasel
threaded the way to the heart of the cairn, and,
poking his snake-like head round the angle of
rock, saw the curled-up forms of the animals
whose scent had drawn him thither. But a single
peep satisfied his curiosity, and he went out into
the blazing sunlight, fragrant with the perfume
of the furze. Then the mother otter slept like
the cubs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ravine was weird with the shades of
night, raven and magpie were asleep, when the
nomads left the cairn and took to the trail.
Like three shadows they stole over the crest
above and entered the covert. In the silence of
that still, sultry night they might have been
heard forcing a way where the furze was densest,
and presently they emerged from the lower edge,
and, traversing a strip of open ground where a
rabbit was feeding, came to a stream. This they
crossed by springing from rock to rock, the otter
first and the male cub last. In the same order
they threaded the oak coppice that clad the
opposite steep, and made their way over the
craggy summit that crowned it. And so they
passed stream after stream, surmounted ridge
after ridge of the wild watershed, and gained
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
the outlying spur where the cultivated lowland
lay before them. It looked like a sombre,
blurred plain unrelieved by water, until the
moon rode clear of the clouds and revealed the
winding reaches of the tidal <a id='creek'></a>creek for which
they were bound. Their destination was yet a
good way off, but as the going was now very
easy the tireless creatures covered the fields at a
swinging pace. The pastures seemed strange to
the cubs; stranger still the sheep and cattle,
asleep at such an hour without a bush to hide
them; but leaving them lying there, the otters
kept straight on. A homestead rose almost
across their trail; the <a id='trail1'></a>trail, however, had been
traced ages before the buildings were raised or
even the land was broken, and though disturbed
by spade and plough a thousand times, it was still
the otters’ way, so mother and cubs kept to it
faithfully, past the snow-white hawthorns and
into the rickyard, where they stayed to roll and
dry their coats, wet from the mowing-grass. The
stamping of a horse’s feet sent them off before
they had finished; but what alarmed them much
more was a scarecrow in a top-hat standing
amongst the growing corn. The suspicious
creatures gave a wide berth to this horror, and
kept looking back to see whether it was following,
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
until presently they caught the scent of
water; then they never gave it another thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In their eagerness to reach the fishing-ground
they increased their pace across the three enclosures
that separated them from it; but at the
sight of the smooth, broad creek the cubs stood
and gazed, till a call from their mother reminded
them there was no time to be lost. So they
made down the bank and over the beach to join
her on the rocky foreland, round which the
current was eddying. Together they dived
and scoured the sandy bed in search of prey.
In her anxiety to secure supper, the otter soon
got separated from the cubs, who, through inexperience,
wasted their efforts in vain pursuit of
the <a id='bass'></a>bass instead of questing for the flat-fish that
were to be had for the finding. In the end they
tired without having obtained a meal. The last
time they landed they were near the wooded
island where the <a id='heron1'></a>herons build, a long way from
the point where they took to the tide, and it was
whilst lapping the water of a runnel there that
they heard their mother’s call from far down the
creek. At once they hurried along the strand,
answering as they ran, and even after they had
taken to the flood they repeated their shrill
whistlings until they reached her side. To their
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
delight, a big flat-fish lay at her feet, its white
underside uppermost. The smell of the prey,
strange though it was, so pleased them that their
nostrils twitched with anticipation. Indeed, the
flounder was an appetizing morsel for creatures
sated with eels and trout, and soon all three were
busy devouring it. They were not long over the
feast, but they had scarcely finished when the
grey light stealing across the creek drove them
to a <a id='cave1'></a>cave in the overgrown bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not a hover suddenly chanced on, but
a much-frequented place of call that the otter
intended making for when she left the cairn.
The dank vault had been occupied the day
before, as was evident from the dry place on
the slab, but it was untenanted then, save by a
few bats hanging from the low roof, and it
afforded the new-comers the accommodation they
required. The mother chose the ledge close to
the landing-place, whilst the cubs scrambled to
a shelf above, along the rude way worn in the
slaty wall by generations of their tribe. Before
curling up for the day, the otters, as was their
wont, teased with their claws every bit of under-fur,
and removed the thorns and furze-spines
about which it had matted. Then, liking the
taste of the salt water, they licked themselves
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
until their glossy coats were as smooth as satin.
As soon as their toilet was finished they settled
down to sleep, and so soft was their breathing,
so thoroughly did their dark pelt harmonize with
its surroundings, that there was nothing to betray
their presence except eyes which glowed in the
sombre light until the lids closed and hid their
amber fires.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>AT THE CREEK</p>

<p class='pindent'>The otter was awakened about noon by the
patter and drip of the rain that had silenced the
birds in the woods outside, but the cubs slept
through it all. The downpour, which lasted off
and on for hours, ceased towards sundown, and
at star-peep the sky had cleared of clouds, save
where a black pall hung over the uplands. The
otters then stole from the cave, coming singly
through the mouth and, keeping within the
shadow of the rocky wall, landed on the beach
beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After shaking their coats, they made down
the creek over the rain-pitted sand until nearly
abreast of a rock showing above the surface, and
there took to the water. For awhile it looked
as if they meant to cross to the opposite shore,
but on reaching mid-stream they dived, and the
next minute were busy detaching <a id='muss'></a>mussels from
the bed of the channel. The bubbles which kept
rising showed the position of the animals, which
presently came up with their mouths full of
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
shell-fish and swam swiftly to land. There the
otter dropped the mussels she carried, seized
one between her paws, bit off the end of
the shell and devoured the fish. Scarcely had
she swallowed it before the cubs were busy
breaking the brittle shells and feasting on the
succulent contents; and the crackling noise that
broke the silence would have puzzled any chance
visitor to the wood, but was no unfamiliar sound
to the birds that roosted in the overhanging oaks.
The otters made several journeys to and from the
mussel-bed, till they had eaten their fill; then
fell to gambolling on the edge of the tideway,
to the annoyance of a <a id='heron2'></a>heron, which soon took
wing for a station higher up the creek. Two or
three hours they there spent in play, varied by
excursions into the wood, where they startled a
hare and put the brooding pheasants in a fever.
Once they penetrated to the craggy summit,
climbed the rocks, lapped the water in the
highest of the basins, and, before jumping down,
gazed across the intervening country to where
the <a id='estu1'></a>estuary glimmered between its dusky shores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beach was almost covered by the advancing
tide when the otters took to the water and
drifted up with the flood. Their outstretched
limbs being flush with the surface, they looked
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
like floating skins as the current bore them along;
but soon after passing the heron, spectral in the
uncertain light, they began swimming, and so
entered the cave, where they shook their coats
and lay down in the places they had occupied
the day before. The lapping of the tide was
their slumber-song, and the happy creatures were
sound asleep before the last of the bats came
flitting in to roost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day a fiery sun beat down upon the
country-side and exhausted toiler and sportsman
abroad in the sweltering heat. The mower
sweated and panted behind the scythe, the
otter-hunters crossing the moor longed for the
cool woods they had left, and the boy on the
smack at the end of the creek gobbled up his
pasty to spend the dinner-hour in the pool
beneath the bridge. Not only man and boy
suffered from the heat; beast and bird too
sought the shade, abandoning their haunts to
the insect hosts that revelled in the scorching
rays. The flower-gay selvage margining the far
shore of the creek and the tangle of honeysuckle
and wild-rose that curtained the portals of the
otters’ lair, hummed with the noise of countless
wings. Honey-bees were there, green-bodied
flies and blue, and, preying on them, <a id='dragon'></a>dragon-flies
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
that darted to and fro, casting sharp
shadows on yellow sand-bank and sapphire pool.
But, glaring and dazzling as was the light, no
ray penetrated the gloom that shrouded the
otters, who never moved until near their usual
stirring-time. Then they rose, but only to
stretch themselves, for they lay down again,
listened to the fading voices of the mowers, and
watched the afterglow pale upon the face of the
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, when all was still and the light
sombre, they slipped noiselessly into the current,
raising scarce a ripple as they passed from pool
to pool on their way down the creek. They
landed at the turn below the mussel-bed to
quench their thirst, then took to the water again,
and were soon busy disporting themselves in
<a id='dead'></a>Deadman’s Pool. On leaving it, they moved
forward, climbing every rock, and resting there
as if they enjoyed the warmth till, two miles
beyond the pool, they came to where the creek
broadens between marshy flats given over to
wild-fowl. As it was in this reach that the otter
intended to hunt when the coming tide had
brought up the fish that came there to feed, she
and the cubs landed and played about on the
bank to while away the time of waiting. Presently
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
they entered the fen, where they disturbed
some wild-duck and set the moorhens calling in
notes of alarm which were taken up by the fowl
on the other side of the creek, but subsided the
instant the intruders’ gambols showed they had
no murderous intentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close on midnight, when the tide was about
half flood, the otter, with the cubs at her side,
re-entered the creek in search of flat-fish. Her
quest was no easy one, for she had crossed the
sandy bottom but once before the fish, becoming
aware of the presence of their dreaded enemies,
gave up feeding, and buried themselves in the
sand. A pair of eyes dotted here and there
about the wide bed was all that showed, and it
was for this sign of the fish’s presence that the
otter searched, jerking her head this way and
that to scan the ground on each side of her
course. At the fourth dive she suddenly sighted
prey, as suddenly ceased propelling herself, and
stopped within a foot of the spot where the restless
eyes were watching her, while the cubs, who
had shot past, turned, full of wonder, and rejoined
their mother. Then the otter stretched
out a fore-leg, touched the <a id='plaice'></a>plaice through the
thin layer of sand and put it to flight. The cubs,
taken aback by the unexpected appearance of
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
the fish, did not move till it had got some yards
away, but once in pursuit the male cub soon
recovered the lost ground, seized the prey, rose
to the surface, and swam ashore. Two more
plaice were captured within the hour, one by the
cubs without assistance, and from that moment
their mother let them quarter the sand alone.
They propelled themselves by their hind-legs as
their mother did, the fore-legs being pressed
against the side, except when used for sudden
turning movements; but on rising to the surface
all four limbs came into play, while the massive
tail alone did the steering. When their hunger
was appeased they made up the creek, ducking
their heads as they went, until a stone fell from
the crumbling cliff above Deadman’s Pool and
scared them; they then gave over their bobbing,
but redoubled their speed, passing the flotsam at
a rapid pace, and all the way to the cave they
scanned the banks as if they dreaded an ambush,
though they had never once been waylaid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day, whilst awaiting the dusk, the otter
resolved to make a journey up the creek after
the school bass. The tide did not serve before
midnight; then the rain, which had threatened,
began to fall and, as the animals drifted by the
herons’ island, was coming down in torrents, but
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
under it the current bore them rapidly along the
reaches without sign of man’s neighbourhood,
save a disused limekiln, until the last bend
brought them within sight of a bridge and of the
hamlet that straggles down the hillside to a
wharf on the water’s edge. When they were
abreast of it the bass began to rise, and drew
them in pursuit. Shooting up from below, the
hunters seized the unsuspecting fish, and soon
were busy eating their take, the cubs on buoys,
the otter on a projecting stone of one of the
buttresses of the bridge. Once all three landed
under the farthest arch and dropped their prey
in affright at the unexpected presence of the
parish <a id='const'></a>constable, who was sheltering there and
was almost as much scared himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the crowing of the village cocks warned
the otter that she ought to withdraw; but it was
not until the smoke began to rise from the galley
of the smack by the wharf that she at last gave
up fishing and made for the drain hard by, where
she had twice laid up before. Against a strong
head of water they forced their way up the
tunnel till they came to the rude ledges of
masonry in it, and there curled up as best they
could for the day. The cubs had never hovered
in such scant quarters before, but their discomfort
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
was as nothing in comparison with the terror
which the rumbling of a van over their heads
occasioned them. In the course of the morning,
towards noon, things were still worse. A <a id='sheep'></a>sheep-dog
with a nose for otters winded them, and
came and sniffed at the grating within a couple
of yards of where they lay. In his excitement
he kept pawing the iron bars and whimpering
until the cry of ‘Shep, boy!’ recalled him to the
flock, the patter of whose feet had set the otters
on the alert before the dog darkened the twilight
of their hiding-place. These were the great
alarms of the day—indeed, the only alarms, for
the otters took little notice of the bell which rang
each time a customer entered the grocer’s shop,
and scarcely more of the voices of the children
abroad when the rain ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The street was deserted and the windows
aglow when the otters made their way down the
drain and, after listening at the mouth, stole out
into the moonlight. They ran some danger of
being seen as they approached the smack, and
again after passing it, but fortune favoured them;
they escaped observation, and got clear away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They kept to the margin of the creek till near
the limekiln. Then the otter struck inland, with
stealthy motion threading the tufts that covered
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
the rising ground. Half-way up the slope she
suddenly turned and looked at the cubs as if
a careless step had annoyed her, but at once
resumed her stalk. Presently her nostrils
twitched; she had scented a <a id='rabbit'></a>rabbit that was
feeding just over the brow. Coming within
sight of the unsuspecting creature she gathered
herself for a spring, and a <a id='fox3'></a>fox could scarcely
have launched itself more swiftly than did the
otter. A timely movement, however, saved the
rabbit, which, with others feeding there, gained
the shelter of the bank. Balked of her prey,
the otter stood for a moment where the unavailing
leap had taken her, but as soon as the cubs
came up she made for the biggest of the holes,
and through it all three disappeared. Rabbits
popping out here and there along the bank
showed how quickly the otters traversed the
set, and presently the male cub, looking with its
arched back like a big ferret, issued from the
hole out of which a rabbit had come and, following
the scent with great eagerness, entered
another hole into which it had darted. The
mother otter, meanwhile, had been more successful,
for a squeal underground heralded her
appearance with a dead rabbit in her mouth,
closely followed by the cubs. When she had
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
bitten off the head and the pads, she removed
the skin as if it had been a glove, and broke up
the carcass. Except for a few <a id='mhen'></a>moorhen, it was
the first warm prey the cubs had eaten, and they
devoured it greedily, as they did their share of
another rabbit surprised in the furze beyond the
burrow. This ended the night’s hunting, and
leaving the out-turned skins on the turf, the
otters went back to the creek across the dewy
grass which they marked with a clearly visible
track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On gaining the shore they burst into a
gallop from sheer high spirits, spurning the sand
as they hurried along the lone reach in a silence
unbroken save by the sob of the restless tide that
was mounting along their path. Within a mile
of the heronry they crossed the flood and sported
in the great eddy there; at times they landed
on the cone-shaped rock that rose amidst the
swirl and cast its inky shadow on the silvery
surface. The playful creatures seemed to have
set aside their fears and lingered till sunrise,
when the shout of a farm-boy to a neighbour
caused them to dive and make for the cave.
Time after time they rose to breathe, always in
the slack water, and at last, when the brimming
tide was all ablush and every songster pouring
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
out its greetings to the sun, they gained their
sanctuary beyond the reach of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus day followed day and week succeeded
week, until they had got to know the creek as
they knew the morass. By the beginning of
August there was not an inlet left unexplored
nor a stream unvisited. The biggest of the
streams they followed to its source among the
hills, within easy reach of the sea, and laid up
there, but partly retraced their steps the next
night, and curled up at dawn beneath the roots
of a sycamore that overhung a mill-pool. That
day very heavy rain fell, and continued till a
late hour, soaking the country-side and causing
even the cave to drip, to the discomfort of the
otters, who repaired there on the morrow. This
decided the otter to make without further delay
for the sea, and that night, after a big feast on
the mussels, she led the cubs along the widening
reaches to the estuary and couched on an island
at the meeting of the waters. A barge drifted
by at sunrise; later a peel leaped within a few
feet of them; but the otters heeded neither the
one nor the other, nor, indeed, did they raise their
heads until a boy, blowing a penny may-horn,
came to fetch the geese from the moor opposite,
and startled them not a little. But by this
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
time the sun was dipping below the pines near
the homestead; it was almost time to be afoot,
and as soon as the stars were bright, the otters
took to the water and began the descent of the
estuary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river, in spate after the rains, bore them
swiftly along, now between long spits of sand,
now close to the shadowed banks, dotted here
and there with <a id='glow'></a>glow-worms. The surroundings
were as peaceful as the drifting was easy; yet
safe as the way seemed there was danger ahead,
and a mile or so down they came on one of the
worst enemies of their kind. They saw him the
instant they rounded the bend; and little wonder,
for the burly figure was clearly outlined against
the latticed window of the <a id='keep2'></a>keeper’s cottage.
Had he moved, they would merely have sunk
out of sight; had he coughed or sneezed, they
would have dived, to reappear a furlong below.
But to scare them was the last thing he wished,
and, excited though he was, he never moved a
muscle. He had set a <a id='trap1'></a>trap for the otters, which
he knew would follow the peel; and since dusk
he had been all ears for the rattle of the chain
that would tell of a capture. As soon as they
were gone by, he rose and tiptoed along the
bank, wondering, as he picked his way, what
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
made them go down when the <a id='peel1'></a>peel were running.
By the trunk of a dead ash he stopped to
listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The otters, on coming to the loop where the
estuary wellnigh returns upon itself, landed, as
the keeper knew they would, and passed through
a belt of young larch to a glade in which the
still air was heavy with the scent of flower and
fern, and a <a id='night'></a>night-jar was busy among the moths.
When nearly across it, the otter swerved from
the trail to avoid the coppice where her mate
had been trapped. It was not likely she could
mistake the spot, for she had stood by him till at
dawn the footfall of the keeper had driven her
away. She had even returned the two following
nights, and called and called and called before
going off alone to prepare a nest for her unborn
cubs. And now another trouble beset her: the
male cub persisted in following the trail, and,
owing to his great strength, succeeded, despite
all her efforts, in getting amongst the bushes
where the trap was set. He was on the point of
putting his pad on the plate, when, in desperation,
she bit him and made him turn. As he did
so she closed with him, for she would rather kill
him than suffer him to fall a victim to man; but
when, at the sound of the struggle, the keeper
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
came crashing through the undergrowth, the
otter made off, and the cub followed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They struck the estuary near a jetty piled
with bundles of oak-bark, floundered through the
mud, and reached the river. The tedious bend,
of which the otters had crossed the neck, now
lay behind, and in front stretched the long reach
marked by broad sand-banks that the tide was
beginning to crawl over. So otter and cubs,
after passing two branch creeks, musical with
the whistlings of night-feeding birds, came to
the deeper water, where hulks rode at their last
anchorage, and, farther on, to the landlocked
haven in which tall-masted vessels swung to
their moorings, and the lights of a little seaport
and fishing village winked at one another across
the salt waters. On viewing the uncanny lights
and hearing the shouts of a drunken sailor the
male cub sidled up to his mother; and great was
his relief when she rounded the rocky promontory
that projects into the harbour, and entered the
tranquil creek, whose waters reflected only the
friendly moon.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span><h1>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>SEA AND MARSH</p>

<p class='pindent'>The otters landed opposite a white buoy, and,
to pass the time till the fish came in, played
about on the rocks that strewed the shore.
When the tide had covered most of them, the
otter set out to reconnoitre, and had not been
gone long before she summoned the cubs to join
her. At the signal they took to the water, and
soon reached the spot where she awaited them.
On seeing her excitement they became excited
too, dived the instant she did, and the three,
swimming in line abreast, soon viewed the prey.
It was but the merest glimpse they got of half
a score tails, for the fish, finding there were
three otters, wheeled round in affright and fled
before their advance. At this timid manœuvre,
so favourable to their purpose, the otters, eager
though they were to seize the prey, rose to vent,
and on resuming the chase came on the alarmed
<a id='mull'></a>mullet in a fathom of water. Further retreat
meant certain capture, and the mullet—craftiest
of all the finny tribe—knew it. So the little
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
school of fish made a dash for the deeper water,
and, as the otters flashed up from beneath to
seize them, scattered, leaping wildly to avoid the
fatal grip. The confusion of that moment taxes
description, but one detail stands out clear—the
effort of the otter to reach the leader in its leap
for life. She did indeed lip it, but no more;
and the fish, which in its fall splashed the water
into ripples of silver, got right away and resumed
the lead of the retreating shoal. A few scales
only remained to mark the scene of the fray, and
the chagrin of the otters was complete when, on
drawing the rest of the water blank, they realized
that every mullet had escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disappointed hunters landed through the
maggoty seaweed which had attracted the fish,
and making their way along the stream that
flows into the creek, reached the mill where the
otter intended to hover. To her dismay she
found the holt behind the wheel in possession of
another otter with cubs, and quite young ones,
as she could tell by their squeals. It was a
difficult situation, for day was near; but she was
equal to it. Without losing an instant, she
hastened back along her trail towards the only
other lodging she knew within easy reach—a
hole in the wall of the quay. They might be
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
detected whilst making for it, so the mother
scanned the sleeping port from the end of the
promontory before committing herself to the
open; but as nobody stirred, the three made
across the estuary straight towards it. When
they were about mid-passage, where the tide ran
strongest, a big fish leaped clear of the water
and fell with a resounding splash. It was a
<a id='salm1'></a>salmon. The cubs turned their questioning
eyes on their mother, but she gave no heed.
She was filled with anxiety lest the hole in the
quay should prove to be beyond their reach.
High above the water though it was, she herself
entered it easily, for she could throw herself out
of the water almost like a <a id='seal1'></a>seal; but, as she had
feared, the cubs fell back again and again. The
whistling of the distressed creatures must have
been audible to anyone on the quay. An old
man was, indeed, there, putting out the green
light which had frightened the cubs as they
crossed, but he was as deaf as his ladder, and
before he approached the edge to see how
high the tide had risen, they had made their
greatest effort and gained the shelter of the
masonry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day they hardly slept a wink. They
were within earshot of the busiest spot in the
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
port, and every one of the varied sounds that
reached them was a cause for fresh anxiety. To
the ceaseless pacing to and fro of hobbler and
pilot there was soon added the shout of the fish-hawker,
the bell of the town-crier, and other
sounds of trade, varied towards noon by the
squeakings of Punch and Judy, the yelping of
Toby, and the roars of laughter that punctuated
their performance—a strange hullabaloo indeed
for the shy wildlings that had been reared in the
quiet of the desolate moorland, where only the
calls of bird and beast reached them; and many
a time through the trying hours they longed to be
back in the morass, under the cairn, or in the
cave now so far back on the trail. Welcome at
last to their eyes were the dying rays that fired
the windows of the cottages across the harbour;
doubly welcome the departure of the last fisherman
from the quay-head. His footsteps had
scarcely died away when the otters slid down the
face of the wall into the water and, threading
the moorings of the boats above them, rose to
the surface in the fairway. Three dark spots
that to the man leaning over the side of the
brigantine might well have seemed three corks,
showed where the otters swam noiselessly towards
the harbour-mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
After they had passed the last buoy and,
indeed, covered most of the mile that separated
them from the lighthouse, they learnt
that they were not the only creatures abroad
that fine summer night. Barely a furlong
could have separated them from the castles that
once guarded the narrow entrance when they
caught sight of some monsters whose noisy
breathing, growing louder and louder as they
drew near, might well have proved most terrifying
to the easily scared cubs, had not their
mother’s indifference convinced them they had
nothing to fear; and presently mother and cubs
were among the shoal of <a id='porp'></a>porpoises, the great
backs of which gleamed as they showed above
the waves. The mother knew the errand of
these corsairs, and understood that they were
raiding the salmon that the flooded river had
attracted from the offing. Awakened memories
of great chases in the pools and of feasts on the
banks flashed across her brain as she swam, and
before she set foot on the point opposite the
lighthouse she resolved to complete the round
with as little delay as possible and regain the
upper reaches of the river, where she could teach
the cubs how to weary out the fresh-run fish and
bring them to the bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
But the lesson she had come to give the cubs
in the <a id='sea1'></a>sea itself was not a whit less important,
she thought, as she watched their wonderment
on beholding the vast liquid plain that stretched
out to no shore their piercing gaze could discern.
Streamlet, pool, river, creek, estuary—all in turn
had been cause for astonishment, but on the ocean
they looked with awe. And it was theirs to fish
in. In the recognition of this spacious hunting-ground
the timid creatures quite forgot the
terrors of the quay, which had but momentarily
passed from their minds in the presence of the
porpoises, and the next minute they were following
in the wake of their mother as she swam
towards the <a id='gullr1'></a>Gull Rock in the midst of the cliff-skirted
bay. Bravely the cubs faced the waves,
and bravely they battled with the surf through
which they landed; then they looked to their
mother to direct them how to fish in the deep
water by which they were surrounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had not long to wait. After a glance at
the birds on the ledges above her head, she dived;
both cubs instantly dived, too, and putting forth
all the strength of their hind-legs, they succeeded
in keeping her in sight along the spiral course by
which she made her way down and down to the
bottom, full six fathoms below. To their surprise,
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
they found the bed of the sea alive with
tiny shell-fish, which they spurned here and there
as they quested. On their left rose a wall of
rock, in turning the point of which they came
face to face with a turbot, that the otter seized
and bore writhing to the surface. The cubs,
who rose with her, kept gripping the fish as they
swam, and by the time they reached the landing-place
it had ceased to struggle. Then all three
settled down to the feast. Nothing but the tail
and backbone remained when they again took to
the water. This time they made the circuit of
the rock, and the male cub, rising from beneath,
seized a pollack, carried it in triumph to a reef
just a-wash with the tide, and there consumed it.
Before he had quite finished, the other cub, and
later, the otter, were busy devouring <a id='wrasse1'></a>wrasse they
had taken. When they had eaten their fill, the
young otters amused themselves in capturing fish
which they no longer needed but left uneaten;
and it was over these abandoned spoils that the
<a id='gull1'></a>gulls clamoured at dawn, whilst the otters lay in
a <a id='cave2'></a>cave they had entered by a submerged mouth
at the foot of the cliffs. Curled up in pits on the
sand above the line of flotsam, with the roar of
the sea to lull them, the cubs soon dropped
asleep; but the mother, her thoughts on the big
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
silvery salmon, lay awake making her plans, till
at length she, too, yielded to her fatigue and
slept like the cubs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night had fallen when the otters stole through
the outlet, left half uncovered by the ebb, and
swam with rapid strokes for the head of the bay.
They were off to a new fishing-ground. They
landed where a stream crosses the beach and,
striking into the valley down which it flows, followed
its course without a halt, until they reached
the junction of the two rivulets that form it.
There, however, the otter stood irresolute. Each
water led towards a delectable destination—the
one to the salmon pools, the other to her native
<a id='marsh1'></a>marsh, with its abundant food-supply and secure
hovers among the reed-beds—and which to make
for she could not decide, until it struck her that
the cubs might never find the outlying water
without her. Then she set aside her hesitation,
and held along the western branch at a pace
quicker than before, as if to recover the time
lost in making up her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the valley about a mile above the
confluence, she cut straight across the middle of
the hilly field to the upper corner, where a flock
of lambs stood awestruck to watch the strange
intruders climb the bank into the next pasture,
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
from which the otters could hear the startled
creatures stamping with excitement, until first
the otter, then the cubs one after the other, got
over the wall and dropped into a neglected road.
This led to a stately gateway with big iron gates,
and beneath them the animals crept to the moss-grown
drive, flecked by the moonlight which
filtered through the arching crowns of the oaks.
They passed a mole-heap or two and numerous
little pits scratched by rabbits, but the way was
innocent of rut or hoof-mark or any evidence of
man’s proximity. Yet they had not long been
following its windings before they all at once
found themselves face to face with a scene that
filled them with consternation. At a spot where
the road makes a sharp bend about an angle of
the cliff lay a heap of ruddy embers, and near
them a dog. The animal was not asleep, but
stretched to his full length and, as his restless
ears showed, alert to the slightest sound. His
every movement was visible against the dying
fire, the glow of which fell on the curtained
window of a caravan and dimly revealed the
gnarled branches above it. The otters, thoroughly
alive to the danger of attack, stood ready to
defend themselves; but, seeing that the enemy
gave no sign, they sidled towards the overgrown
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
riding-path just beyond the firelight, and gained
it without attracting the dog’s attention. The
moment, however, the herbage rustled with their
movements his head was raised and pointed
towards the very spot where they stood concealed.
Still as death, they regarded the lurcher
through the fronds, nor did they advance a single
step till the drooping of the pricked ears and the
resettling of the long head on the fore-legs showed
that suspicion was lulled. Then, with a stealth
that cheated the prating ferns, they left their
shelter, stole noiselessly as shadows past the
<a id='gip'></a>gipsy’s bivouac and the side road by which the
human nomads had come, and escaped into
the safe darkness beyond, where the murmur of
the sea far below reached their ears.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After passing the <a id='haunt'></a>haunted house to which the
long avenue led, they came to a cairn with a
roofless lookout, so placed as to survey the wild
coast-line. Here the wanderers again struck
inland until they came to a high wall that
threatened to bar their advance. But the otter
knew the way and, threading the nettles bordering
the stubble, reached the drain that gives easy
access to the park. As if glad to be clear of the
prickly harvest-field, the little band made down
the slope at a gallop, passing between groups of
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
trees that cast deep shadows on the turf. In the
herbage of the hollow only their backs showed,
but every hair was exposed when they breasted
the opposite slope, over whose crest the land dips
abruptly to a fishpond. At a headlong pace they
dashed between the stems of the pines to the
edge of the water, into which they glided as
noiselessly as voles. So swift were their movements
that almost before their presence was
known each otter had seized a white trout and
risen to the surface. One came up near the
boathouse, another in the shadow of an hydrangea,
the third near the only bit of moonlit bank by
the overflow; and all three swam towards the
island, where they lay under the plumes of the
pampas-grass and devoured their take. They
ate three or four fish apiece before their hunger
was satisfied, and then began chasing one another
over the rocks, from which the sea stretched like
a plain of beaten silver. Soon they returned
along the overflow to the pond, where they gambolled
as fearlessly as they had done in the creek
and other lone spots in their wanderings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the surprise of the cubs, the taint of man
on the path caused their mother no disquietude;
not once did she stop her play to listen or peer
into the bosky gloom about her. Strange disregard
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
of danger in a creature both suspicious
and apprehensive, yet not difficult of explanation.
For all the demesne within the park wall had
long been a <a id='sanc'></a>sanctuary for bird and beast. Not a
gun had been fired there nor a trap set time out
of mind; and so confiding had even otters become
that they used the drain on the island to litter
in, and would lay up in the holt by the moat
under the very windows of the mansion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind one of these a light had just before
been burning, where the young <a id='squire1'></a>squire sat recording
the day’s sport with his hounds along the
stream in which the otter had taught the cubs
to fish. But as he wrote he heard the otter
whistle. On the instant he dropped his pen,
turned down the lamp and, seizing a field-glass,
took his seat by the open window. Keen otter-hunter
as he was, he was no less keen a naturalist.
Deer, foxes, badgers, seals, all interested him,
though not to the same degree as the otter. The
fascination this creature had for him was wonderful.
To him it was the homeless hunter, the
Bedouin of the wild, the subtlest and most
enduring of quarry, the gamest of the game.
Therefore he sat with glass to eye watching the
lighted space between two clumps of rhododendrons
where he expected the otters would
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
show. His hands shook and his heart beat
faster than its wont; for the life of him he could
not suppress the excitement he felt. Presently
a shadow, a moving shadow, followed by another
and yet another, darkened the sward—these
were the otters; and without a wink he watched
them cross the turf to the ferny border of the
moat, where, though he could see them no longer,
he could follow their movements by the twitching
of the fronds till, a few seconds later, they
entered the water and pursued their graceful
gambols full in his view. Once the otter,
attracted by scent or sound, or both, half rose
out of the moat and looked over the low bank;
but the moment she saw that the intruders were
only a <a id='bad2'></a>badger and two cubs she fell again to her
romps. Later she looked up and scrutinized the
strange object at the window. The squire remained
as motionless as the gargoyles; her suspicion
was allayed, and once more she resumed
her frolics. Anon the trio stole away and,
passing through the drain beneath the park wall
by which the badgers had found an entrance,
gained the valley where the weary hounds lay
asleep in their <a id='ken'></a>kennels. But without a thought
of hound or anything else save the marsh to
which she was hurrying, the otter made across
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
the barren holdings beyond and, before the squire
had given up hope of their reappearance and
resumed his pen, she had dropped from the
boundary wall of Cold Comfort Farm and set
foot on the waste that stretches to the very tip
of the promontory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wanderers kept near the cliffs, going
straight from angle to angle of the indentations
that mark the jagged coast-line. Here and there
they moved along the edge, so close one behind
the other as to look like one creature, presenting
even, at times, a snake-like appearance, especially
when twisting in and out of the colony of ant-heaps
that dotted the long slope within a mile of
their destination. Near the top they disturbed
a wheatear from amongst some cushions of withered
sea-pinks; but not another creature did they
see until abreast of the seal rock, where a <a id='corm1'></a>cormorant
stood watching for the dawn. Then,
striking the marsh at the end of a finger-like
creek, they followed the bank above it till the
mere with its <a id='reed2'></a>reed-beds lay before them. Not
a breath ruffled the surface: the array of stems
stood motionless as forest-trees: all was strangely
still, save that the sea was heaving ominously.
After a keen scrutiny of the cottage opposite
them and a single glance at the sand-bar to the
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
left, the otter trotted down the bank and, entering
the water, swam towards the farther shore.
But when near the wall of reeds she half-wheeled,
and coasted along the curves of the little bays,
skirting the lily-beds where she had disported
when a cub.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Till now the finny tenants of the mere had
given no sign of their presence; but as the otters
drew near the inflow a dace jumped out of the
water, and the jaws of a pike showed above the
surface within a few inches of it. The sight
stirred the hunting instincts of the male cub,
and so great was his rage at his mother’s indifference
that, when she crossed the current on
her way to the creek, he turned back, determined
to hover by himself. He landed on a
point between two bays and trampled a couch
at the food of the reeds. An old otter could not
have chosen a kennel seemingly safer, yet scarcely
had he curled up when a most alarming noise
struck his ears. It was the creak of oars against
the thole-pins, and it grew louder and louder till
he jumped to his feet to see what was coming.
Almost immediately the bow of a <a id='boat1'></a>boat appeared
round a clump of bulrushes, and at the oars bent
the old <a id='man1'></a>marshman in his reed-plaited hat and
guernsey frock, all lit up by the red sun, now just
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
above the bar. The rower shipped the oars,
turned round on his seat, and dropped the <a id='kill'></a>killick
quietly overboard; but the boat still moved forward
till the painter stopped the way on it, less
than a score of yards from the otter, who looked
on at the baiting and setting of the lines, and
even the lighting of a pipe before the old man
settled down to watch the floats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Motionless though the fisherman sat, the otter
remained on the alert and, whenever the old
man rose to land a fish, was on the point of
diving and making his escape from so dangerous
a neighbour. Thus hour after hour passed, and
the morning wore away with no change in the
situation, save that a little before noon black
clouds rose above the horizon and drifted into
the blue spaces of the sky. Intent on his fishing,
the marshman took little notice of the sudden
change of weather, until a gust of wind shook
the reed-bed and big drops of rain began to fall.
Then, casting a few uneasy glances to windward,
he pulled in his lines, raised the killick, pressed
his hat on his head, and rowed away.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>THE FAMILY BROKEN UP</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting there, the cub watched the lurid afterglow
fade, dusk creep over the rough water, and
the sky darken till a star appeared in a break
between the scudding wrack. Then he rose and
listened. The waves broke against the point,
the reeds hissed, the breakers thundered on the
bar, but no call from his mother reached his
eager ears. He was beginning to fear she had
deserted him when from across the mere came
the shrill summons. Immediately he dived and,
rising almost at once, headed at excited pace for
the creek, where soon, to his delight, he viewed
his mother and sister swimming to meet him.
The wild gambols that followed in the midst of
the mere did not last long, for there was hunting
to be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quarry the otter had set her mind on
were the <a id='pike1'></a>pike frequenting the reedy bays, towards
the largest of which the hunters swam. Near a
bed of lilies they dived, and had not made half
the circuit of the wall of stems before they espied
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
a pike. He had already seen them, and in an
instant the protruding muzzle was withdrawn as
the fish backed into his ambush. It afforded him
no refuge from the pursuers, who drove him from
one to another of its recesses, and pressed him so
closely that, as he saw, to remain meant capture.
Out he flashed and, had he made right away and
gained the heart of the mere, he would have
escaped. But he sought the shelter of another
lily-bed almost within sight of the first, and there
the otters followed in unrelenting chase. Presently
he was gripped by the male cub, but,
freeing himself, forsook the weeds for the water
outside, where, with distended jaws and fins
erect, he darted now here, now there, to avoid
his harassing pursuers. All was in vain. He had
missed his earlier opportunities, and to escape in
his exhausted condition was impossible. Conscious
of this and determined not to die unavenged, he
summoned his remaining strength, dashed at the
otter, seized her by the throat, and held on
despite her struggles. This however left him at
the mercy of the cubs. Instantly they fastened
on his shoulders and, using their powerful rudders,
tried to raise him to the surface. Beating his
tail, the fish for awhile succeeded in resisting
their efforts; but in the end he tired, and presently
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
the writhing mass came to the top of the
lake and, rolling over and over, showed now on
the crest, now in the trough of the waves. There
the otter wrenched herself free and, half-throttled
though she was, at once joined in the attack.
The three soon overpowered their prey and
landed with it at an opening in the reeds. Whilst
they were dragging it from the water’s edge a
tremor passed through the fish. Immediately
the hungry hunters relaxed their hold, fell to
and sliced and sliced and champed and champed
till wellnigh half the fish was eaten and the
great backbone showed. The feast over, they
licked their chops, brushed their whiskers against
the stems and, taking to the water, played hide-and-seek
amongst the lilies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exultation they felt over their capture
showed in their excited gambols and in their
wild rush through the <a id='reed3'></a>reed-bed on their way to
the bar. They crossed this at a gallop to the
edge of the tide, plunged into the breakers and,
reaching the quieter water beyond the surf,
headed straight for the great pile of rocks over
which the spray was dashing in clouds. On
landing, they threaded the sobbing passages
between the boulders and gained the caves that
honeycomb the cliff behind. There they came
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
on the remains of old feasts—fish bones, crab and
lobster shells—and on old nests made of reeds.
One cave there was where the muffled boom of
the waves was broken by the tinkle of falling
water, and where the skeletons of otters whitened
the floor on the edge of the runlet that had worn
a channel in the rock. Quickly leaving it, the
animals made their way back along the low,
tortuous passage by which they had entered and,
passing through the outer caves, regained the
<a id='clitt1'></a>clitter. There they chased one another until
they tired. Then they took to the sea, reached
the line of the breakers, and landed through the
welter as easily as, later, they landed on the bank
of the mere by the inflow. The otter was then
leading her cubs to the withy-bed and to the
boggy ground between it and the <a id='decoy'></a>old decoy,
where she trod the <a id='mint'></a>water-mint as she went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the hours of darkness were spent, and when
the grey light told of coming day otter and cubs
slipped into the stream and drifted towards the
mere. On reaching the choppy water they fell
to swimming, turned up the sheltered creek,
skirted the island where two of them had kennelled
the day before, and landed near a bramble
brake, in which they curled up side by side. The
cubs soon slept, but the excitement of the
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
journey to the salmon river kept the otter awake
longing for dusk, so eager was she to cross the
moors and reach the pools. She dropped asleep
at last, but awoke long before setting-out time
and, whilst awaiting nightfall, watched the angry
sun go down and the clouds scud by close overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before it was quite dark she aroused the cubs,
and made up the hilly ground towards the heart
of the moor. <a id='trek3'></a>It was a wild night, but the fury
of the gale seemed to quicken the energies of the
wanderers, for they breasted the foothills at a
pace beyond their wont and soon gained the
high plateau with its chain of pools, known to
men as the Black <a id='lidd1'></a>Liddens. These they swam as
they came to them, passed to the heathery waste
with its old Stone Circle, and reached the marshy
valley and the lazy stream which supplies the
mere. The wind had little force there—the
thorns, shaggy with lichen, stood motionless,
even the bulrushes scarcely stirred; but over a
stagnant backwater a <a id='wisp'></a>will-o’-the-wisp kept
dancing like a lantern swung by invisible hands.
Splash! splash! the otters crossed the shallow
pool near the stream; and again, splash! splash!
they rushed through the shoal water beyond it
before turning up the brae that led to the wind-swept
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
moor. On, on the untiring creatures sped,
more like agents of darkness executing some
urgent commission than beasts of prey speeding
to a new fishing-ground. Mile after mile of the
desolate upland they traversed: at one spot
skirting a cairn whence came that weirdest of all
wild cries, the shrill chattering of <a id='bad3'></a>badgers; at
another, passing the only road over the moor,
where they left their footprints between the
fresh wheel-marks of the doctor’s trap. A sleeping
hamlet rose almost in their path, and so close
did they approach that they heard the creaking
of the signboard of the <a id='druid1'></a>Druid’s Arms, about
which the cottages cluster. Then over wall after
wall they clambered as they came to the crofters’
holdings, reached the lodge of the <a id='keep3'></a>keeper who
had been the otter’s terror when her cubs were
helpless, gained the edge of the moorland above
the old nursery, made their way down the very
gully along which the hounds had followed the
fox and, leaping the stream close to the hover,
came out on the salmon pool beyond the
poplar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eager to see whether the pool held a fish, the
otter slipped into the water and swam to the
favourite lie near the foot of the fall. A salmon
was there, and towards it she advanced so swiftly
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
that it seemed she must fasten before it could
become aware of her presence. But the fish had
been harried by otters on its way up from the
estuary, and was prepared for her coming. In a
flash he was off downstream, leaving the otter
far in his wake. At the tail of the pool he
swung round, raising a big wave that greatly
excited the cubs where they watched on the
edge of the bank. After a short interval the
wave came again, and again, and again. Later
the <a id='salm2'></a>salmon leapt clear of the white water near
the fall. And so the chase continued, until the
otter, seeing how vain were her unaided efforts,
summoned the cubs to her assistance. In an
instant they slipped into the pool and joined in
the pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now wherever the salmon turns an otter meets
him. Conscious of the danger he is in, he rushes
at the shallows in a daring attempt to reach the
waters below. His three enemies hurry after
him, breaking the surface in their desperate haste,
and while he is still floundering the otter closes
and strives to grip him beneath the gills. No
defence has he but his slippery scales and the
lashing tail that sweeps his foes aside. But these
avail, and before the teeth fasten in him he
struggles through to the deep water beyond,
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
where he easily outdistances his pursuers. Pool
after pool he passes at his utmost speed, making
for a refuge that lies near the foot of the rapids.
He had rested in it on his way up the river, and
now swings into it and stays there gasping, in
dread of discovery. The otters soon show on the
top of the rushing waters, which they search as
they descend, ducking their heads, and yet avoiding
the rocks against which the current threatens
to dash them. In a few seconds they are close to
the spot where the fish lies exhausted, and surely
one or other will get a glimpse of him. But no,
the sheltering rock befriends him, or the foaming
waters amidst which he lies. The hunters pass
on; but he is not safe yet. If they draw the
rapids against the stream they can hardly miss
him. But will they? Apparently not—at least,
not for the moment. They are going on, despite
the near approach of day. How carefully they
examine the hollow banks and recesses of the
boulders, disdaining even the grilse they disturb,
in their expectation of yet getting the salmon!
Beneath the gloomy pines that form a vista
towards the brightening east they swim, eager as
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, clear of the trees, they all at once
cease their quest and listen. Some suspicious
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
sound downstream has alarmed them. They are
all ears when, above the voice of the river and
the wild rustling of the tree-tops, the penetrating
note again makes itself heard. It is the toot of
the horn. The twice-hunted otter dreads that
sound above all sounds save the cry of the
<a id='hound1'></a>hounds, and before it has died away she and the
cubs are in full retreat to the holt in the salmon
pool. Only at long intervals do they rise to
vent before reaching the rapids, where they leave
the water and gallop up the bank, as if fear
itself were at their heels. At the top they re-enter
the river, and so gain the shelter of the
alder-roots near the fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cubs, feeling safe in the holt, make their
toilet as usual; but the otter listens, and before
long catches the dreaded cry. Then the cubs
hear it too: they begin to share their mother’s
alarm and, when the swelling clamour tells of
the close approach of their enemies, seek the
inmost recess of their refuge. Soon the hounds
enter the pool and cluster like maddened things
about the holt. ‘A good solid mark,’ shouts
the doctor to the squire. ‘He’s there right
enough.’ The foremost hounds can see the
otter where she stands hissing through her white
teeth, but they cannot reach her. So the hounds
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
are called off that a <a id='terr3'></a>terrier may get at the quarry,
and after a terrible fight he compels the otter to
take to the water. Shouts of ‘Heu gaz’ from
the field greet the appearance of the bubbles that
betray her flight, and the next moment the twelve
couple of hounds are in pursuit towards the
stickle, where a dozen men or more stand foot to
foot to prevent her from going down-water.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Round and round the big pool swims the otter,
rising now under the bank, now amongst the
hounds, narrowly escaping their jaws. Time after
time she returns to the cubs, but only to be
ejected by one or other of the terriers. At last,
after being badly shaken by the hounds, she
lands, gallops round the line of men with the
white terrier at her rudder, and gains the water
beyond. At amazing speed she follows the
winding reaches to the rapids, and even succeeds
in gaining <a id='long1'></a>Longen Pool, famous in the annals
of the Hunt. However, the hounds again press
her sorely, and after a while she takes to the
tangled coppice on the hillside, traverses it,
reaches an ancient hedgerow matted with bramble
and thorn, and there lies listening, trusting to
have escaped pursuit. But she has left a burning
scent, and soon the cry of the pursuers warns
her that her hopes are vain. Nevertheless, as
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
she is very weary, and as the pool to which the
hedge runs down offers no harbourage, she
remains where she is. But though the hounds
soon wind her, the denseness of the thicket
hinders them from getting at her until the
terriers force her to the river. In the shallow
water every eye can mark her where she swims
and note her shortening dives. The end is near.
Presently Dosmary seizes her as she rises, and
the pack worries her life out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, when the storm had passed, the
<a id='mill1'></a>miller heard the cries of two otters in the tangled
coppice beyond the orchard, and as he knocked
the ashes from his pipe before going indoors, said:
‘They’re missin’ her, I’m thinkin’.’ He was right.
It was the voice of the cubs calling for their
mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were there again the next night, and the
next; after that they gave up the vain search
and withdrew to the moorland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was well for the young creatures, thus
thrown on their own resources, that they were
able to fend for themselves. Indeed, as has been
seen, the male cub had already shown signs of
revolt against his mother’s authority, and of a
desire for independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was free now, free to roam as he liked, to
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
keep to the trail or leave it as he pleased, to fish
when and where he chose; for his sister had no
influence over him. Yet, for all his selfish, headstrong
ways, he proved a safe leader, his movements
being inspired by the wariness of the
outlawed creature. He was a stickler for good
hours, rising late and couching early. He curbed
his passion for wandering, and showed rare
judgment in the choice of hovers, selecting
always with an eye to strength and invariably
shunning such as were not near deep water
where refuge might be sought in emergency.
On sallying out he generally fished upstream for
a mile or two, gambolled till the night was nearly
gone, and then floated back with the current,
shooting the rapids and lesser falls on the way.
Yet fear haunted both him and his sister, for
they carefully scrutinized every bush, rock, and
bole that might harbour an enemy, and their
fears grew to terror once when they happened on
the remains of one of their kind recently killed
by the hounds. On the discovery they were at
once all consternation, as their puffing and blowing
showed, and forthwith forsook the tributary
for the river, kennelling at the end of their
hurried retreat in a hover below the mill. They
lay in this holt on the following day, but the
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
next found them ensconced under the bank of
the weir pool at Tide End. There they were
waked towards noon by the tide, which rose and
rose till it invaded their quarters, and compelled
them to seek refuge in the opposite bank, where
a young dog-otter was already lying up. Their
coming startled him not a little, but the moment
he saw the new arrivals were otters like himself
he settled down again, and soon all three were
sound asleep. At dusk they journeyed on
together and, after fishing and sporting in the
salmon pool below the morass, sought the roots
of the alder. They lay there again on the
morrow, a morrow momentous in one of its
happenings—the separation of the cubs. For
when, at setting-out time, the male cub began
moving up-water, his sister, till that moment the
most faithful of followers, turned her back on
him and, with the strange otter at her heels,
struck into the wood. She had renounced the
brother for the lover. Is it possible, animal
though she is, that she can abandon the companion
of her life hitherto, without some sign of
regret? May not the slowness of her steps indicate
reluctance to sever the ties that have so
long bound them? Surely it is so, for just as
she is about to enter the undergrowth, she stops
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
and turns her head to find her brother watching
her. The next minute, however, she has passed
out of his sight and out of his life, as, with her
mate, she follows the trail that leads by the
woodman’s cottage and the cairn to the distant
mussel creek whither she is bound.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>THE OTTER AT THE TARN</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the otter held on his way alone, and before
dawn broke sought shelter in the wooded ravine
next the edge of the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rocky recess was one of the favourite holts
of his kind, partly on account of the dry lying it
afforded, but more because of its congenial surroundings.
The seclusion, the gloom, the roar
of the fall, and the tumult of the pool all contributed
to please the shy wildling; and he became
so fond of the ledge by the foaming waters that,
like a <a id='bad4'></a>badger to its earth, the young nomad
returned to it again and again, till at length the
instinct to roam began to cry out against his unnatural
conduct and urged him to seek new
quarters. ‘Wander, wander,’ repeated the voice
that grew more insistent as the days stole by.
‘Tarry, my child, tarry,’ replied the spirit of the
glen; and for a while—a little while—he resolved
to stay. Yet before his short sojourn came to an
end the pool was sought by a hunted <a id='stag'></a>stag and
turned into a pandemonium.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
Not by mere chance, after rounding the base of
<a id='lone2'></a>Lone Tarn, was the beast’s antlered head set for
the ravine. It was there he had first seen the
light. The early weeks of his life had been spent
in the ferny clearing where the otter’s trail ran,
and his mother used to lead him, a dappled calf,
down the steep bank to drink at the shallows of
the otter’s pool. Four years had passed since then;
but the memory of the sombre, sequestered glen
and of the pool at the foot of the high fall was
still clear in his mind, and to them he turned his
wearied steps in the hour of his distress. After
crossing the rugged purlieus of the woodland,
he threaded his way between the stems of the
birches and, entering the ravine at its lower end,
made his way up and up along the shaded waters
until he came opposite the holt, where a submerged
rock permitted foothold. His wild rush
through the shallows had filled the startled
sleeper with alarm; but the otter did not understand
the cause of the strange creature’s distress
until the cry of the pursuers caught his ears—a
cry that swelled louder and louder until every
hound had splashed into the pool and swam
there, baying their quarry with deafening
clamour. More than once whilst the din was at
its height the otter was on the point of slipping
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
into the water and stealing away; but it was
well he refrained, for presently the stag broke its
bay and made off down the river, drawing the
pack after it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, though calm returned to the pool from
which it had been so ruthlessly banished, it
brought no peace to the otter. A <a id='peel2'></a>peel leaped
where the stag had stood, trout rose where the
hounds had clustered, pigeons ‘roohooed’ overhead,
and a squirrel came down and drank at the
water, yet the otter was still perturbed. His
faith in the holt was gone, and he longed for
dusk that he might leave it and get away from
the taint of hound that drowned the scent of
moss and fern and poisoned the sweet, fresh
breath of the river. He did not await the fall of
night, for a faint glow yet lighted the spaces
between the boles when he left, and as he came
out upon the moor, the sky was still red with
the embers of sunset. Far ahead loomed the
familiar outline of the solitary hill, as yet unvisited;
and now at last he determined to follow
the stream that veined it to the summit, and
there find the refuge that the specious ravine
denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a good pace he moved over the heather
and bog till, a furlong or so beyond some stacks
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
of turf, he came to a sudden standstill. It
seemed as if he had caught some suspicious
sound along the back trail, for his head was suddenly
turned that way; but, discerning nothing,
he resumed his brisk trot along the bank that
at this point rose high above the rushing river.
Soon he came to the tributary down which his
mother had led him and, swimming <a id='pool1'></a>Moor Pool,
as the meeting of the waters is called, he crossed
to the opposite bank and kept it till he reached
the troubled <a id='kieve1'></a>‘Kieve’ at the base of the hill. As
though haunted by the memory of the hounds,
he again looked back over the moor, now black
under the stars; but in the end, after peering
long and satisfying himself that no enemy followed
his trail, he slipped into the foaming basin
in search of the trout it contained, and on two of
these fish made a hurried supper before beginning
the climb of the great cone that towered
grim and forlorn above him. He kept close to
the wild, headlong stream, and made the ascent
by scrambling up the rocks that abutted on fall
and cascade. Far, far up, his nostrils caught the
scent of a body of water, and in his eagerness to
reach it he redoubled his pace and soon gained
the crest. There he found himself face to face
with a tarn—a tarn of aspect as forbidding as
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
the strangely contrasted shores that encompass
it, for the sheet of water lies sullen and monotonous
between precipitous rocks and a beach of
grey shingle. No islet rears its head above the
surface; no line of flotsam marks the shelving
strand. The wanderer had come out on the
shingly beach, and after sniffing the water he
trotted leisurely along its edge, and presently
descried a small bed of reeds, till then hidden by
a rocky headland. Gladdened by the discovery,
he mended his pace, yet kept surveying the tarn,
doubtless on the lookout for signs of prey. A
wave in the shallows, a splash, or even a dimple,
any break of the water, would have betrayed the
presence of some finny inhabitant, of which, however,
his nose had given him no hint; but the
surface had no message for him. Neither was
there a single wild-fowl; there was no animal of
any sort. At the far end, however, and almost
in his path as he made the circuit of the pool, lay
the skeleton of a giant <a id='pike2'></a>pike. Though the vertebræ
had dropped into crannies between the
stones, the bleached skull, its open jaws bristling
with teeth, was the most conspicuous object on
that desolate shore. Yet dry bones apparently
had no more interest for him than the newly
risen moon, for he passed on and clambered
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
over the rocks towards the reeds, where he was
soon at work preparing a couch in which to pass
the coming day. The unusual noise awoke a
<a id='buzz2'></a>buzzard in his eyrie above, and kept him awake
until the otter ceased trampling the stems and
entered the water; then he lowered his head on
his wing and dropped asleep again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The otter, meanwhile, swam towards the horn
of the bay, his long back flush with the surface,
scarce rippled by his advance. When clear of
the point, he dived and began exploring the
recesses and ledges. There was not a harbourage
along the cliff’s base that he did not investigate,
but he did not sight a single fish. Reaching the
glassy surface by the overflow, he spreadeagled
himself and drifted more and more quickly
towards the lip of the fall, till it seemed that
nothing could save him from going over; but
within a foot or two of the brink he suddenly
wheeled, and extricated himself by rapid strokes
that took him within a score yards of the beach.
Then he dived again and quested along the
stretch between the shallows and the deep. This
likely hunting-ground also proved as void of fish
as the water under the cliff; so at the farther
end he landed, shook his coat, and rolled on the
shingle, thus catching the skull of the pike, which
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
he sent flying over the stones. The rattle it
made caused him to run after it, and the grim
toy served to amuse him, for he played with it
much as a kitten plays with a ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so had its owner been bandied about by
his forbears. More than one otter, appalled by
his great bulk and terrible jaws, had shrunk
from tackling him: even the father of the cub
was glad, after a tussle that convulsed the
little bay, to reach the rocks and escape with
his life. But famine had effected what no enemy
could effect—a famine caused by the ravages of
otter, of heron, of <a id='corm2'></a>cormorant, of the pike themselves,
reducing the fish one by one till only the
monster of the reedy bay remained. Whilst
strength lasted he made a daily circuit of his
wasted realm for prey to satisfy his maddening
hunger. As his weakness increased, his beat
dwindled, until one day, after but a short cruise,
it was all he could do to regain his station among
the reeds. There he lingered till death claimed
him. His gaunt carcass, still beautiful with its
marblings of olive and gold, rose to the surface,
and the west wind wafted it to the strand, where
the terror of one generation became the sport of
the next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The otter, however, soon tired of toying
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
with the skull and, leaving it where he found
it, he made along the rocks towards the spot
where the precipice rises almost sheer from the
tarn, and began to scour the face of the cliff.
He seemed as surefooted as a marten, and never
once slipped or stumbled as he dropped from
shelf to shelf whose scanty width in places all
but denied foothold. Three times he made the
descent, leaping from ledge to ledge like the
overflow rushing down the hillside; but, unlike
the stream, he leaped in silence, save for the
muffled thud of his spongy feet as they struck
the rock on landing. The last time he dived,
rose at the end of a long swim by the boulder
flanking the outlet, climbed to the top, and lay
down at full length. The water ran from his
unshaken coat, leaving it smooth and refulgent
in the moonlight, as he reposed there gazing at
the windings of the river on the plain below.
Soon however the restless creature rose and
plunged again into the tarn, where he gambolled,
partly on the surface, but chiefly beneath amongst
the currents that well up from the unfathomed
depths. And so the hours sped till, when the
moon had set and the stars wellnigh paled,
he gave over disporting himself and swam towards
his lair. On the way thither, forgetting
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
that he was alone, he uttered the dawn cry, and
the next moment rounded the point and gained
the reeds. In the grey light, the <a id='buzz3'></a>buzzard winging
his way to the moorland saw him curled up
there, holding one of his pads in his mouth,—asleep,
as he knew by the slow, regular rise and
fall of his flank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what creature is that astir near the outlet?
It must be some other wildling come to share
the primal solitude of the hilltop. Yet its movements
are not those of a four-footed beast.
Surely, surely it is a—is it possible? Yes, it is
a man! He is clear of the rocks now, and is
picking his way across the current. Now he has
landed, and look, look how he hurries up the
strand, and how suddenly he drops to the ground
on the crest! Strange conduct in this lone place
and at such an hour! He must be under the
ban of his fellows, a fugitive, maybe, from hue
and cry, and fearful of discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing of the kind. That man is Grylls the
<a id='harb'></a>harbourer, from the deer forest; but otter, not
stag, has drawn him here this morning, and
eagerness to examine the ground below is the
reason of his haste. Already, glass to eye, he
follows the course of the tributary on his left,
hopeful every second of seeing an otter making
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
its way to the clitter near the stream. How
carefully he scans the banks, and what a time he
dwells on the pile of hoary rocks yet spectral in
the uncertain light! ‘No luck, no luck,’ he
mutters, as he turns the glass to the tributary
zigzagging across the western moor. Yet he is
all expectation, and great will be his joy if only
he can get a glimpse of the long, dark creature
hieing to some holt. Away up to the boggy
gathering ground he traces the narrowing water,
surveys in vain the pools amidst that <a id='curl1'></a>curlew-haunted
waste, then with quick movement,
redirects the glass to the clitter, already much
less dim and mysterious. Little wonder that
that particular refuge attracts him so strongly,
that he scrutinizes the approaches so carefully.
It was there that he once marked an otter enter;
and the memory of the sport it gave has drawn
him year after year to the hilltop in the hope of
harbouring another. Again and again he surveys
first one stream, then the other, but with no
better result; then he hurriedly examines the
river from the foot of the hill to Moor Pool,
where the hounds will presently meet. ‘Nothin’
movin’, nothin’ at all, and day close handy.
You may as well shut up the glass.’ Soon the
fleecy clouds crowding the vault are tinged with
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
rose, pool and stream catch the foreglow, the
reflection in the tarn is like an almond grove in
bloom, and the sun shows below the crimson
streaks that had heralded it. At the sight Grylls
returns the glass to his pocket and, feeling
chilled, jumps to his feet and walks briskly up
and down on the rim of the great basin to warm
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had he seen an otter he would by this be
crossing the moor to meet the squire and tell,
instead of pacing to and fro waiting for the
hounds and glancing down now and again
towards the spot where he expects to see them.
It is full day by this, and river and tributary
stream stretch across the purple moorland like
golden threads. ‘Grand mornin’. Ah! if we
can only find!’ he sighed, as the uncertainty of
the sport flashed across his mind. ‘If! But
there, man, ’tes no use iffin’. Wait and hope for
the best.’ All at once the harbourer stopped
and, screwing up his eyes, looked steadily towards
the solitary clump of pines to which from time
to time he had directed his gaze. ‘Here they
come, and a good few with ’em. Ah! ah! and
there’s one, two, three, four comin’ up-river, and
Matthey—it caan’t be anybody else—crossing
the foord. There’ll be a brave little meet to
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
end the season.’ Then he lay down again on
the heather, raised the glass to his eye, and
turned it on the party with the hounds. ‘The
squire and the passun, of coorse. Wonder if
church moosic or hound cry do stir un most.
“Everything in its season, Grylls,” that would be
his answer, and said kindly. He is a good sort,
is the passun, and dearly loves a kill. And
theere’s Doctor Jim, in his white hat. Lor’! he
ain’t missed the <a id='pool2'></a>Moor Pool meet for seven-and-thirty
year. Iss, seven-and-thirty year, Grylls,
and it’s seven-and-thirty times you’ve sat where
you’re sittin’ now to the hour, and wellnigh to
the day, and’—counting the notches on his
stick—‘it’s nine otters you’ve seen killed on the
moor. Who can they be with the Doctor?
Strainyers, I reckon, stayin’ at the big house
most like. Ah! theere’s Black Geordie, and the
keeper, and the landlord, and Tom “Burn the
Reed” walkin’ with the bailiff hisself as large
as life and as brazen as Sally Strout at the
christenin’. Well, he’s got a face, and no
mistake! Wonder how many salmin he’s took
out this turn.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he lay and made his comments whilst
the party approached Moor Pool, but no sooner
did they reach the bank than his demeanour
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
changed and he sprang to his feet as though an
adder had stung him. And no wonder, for the
<a id='hound2'></a>hounds at once struck the line of the otter, and
made down-river at full cry. ‘Well now,
Grylls,’ said he, ‘is it go or stay? Why, stay,
of coorse; sure as you’re alive they’ll be back
again.’ So he stood watching and watching and
watching till hounds and men became blurred by
distance, and at last disappeared into the wood.
‘You’re out of it, git chucklehead!’ said he, as
he lowered the glass. ‘Why didn’t ’ee go down
to the meet as you always do? You’re gettin’
lazy. You’re out of it, out of it, and come
fifteen mile for nothin’! Pick up the pony and
shog home along; there’s nothin’ else for ’ee to
do.’ In his rage he kicked the loose rock at his
feet, and sent it bounding down the face of the
hill. Nevertheless, it was not many seconds
before he was again scrutinizing the spot where
the river falls to the ravine, and before long he
exclaimed, ‘Halloo! what’s that? Ah, theere
’tes again and again; the glint of the horn, I’ll be
bound.’ He was all excitement now, and watching
as he had never watched before in his life.
‘What’s that—eh, eh? It’s they, it’s they!
See, thee’re crossin’ the bend of Zingey Pool.’
Though the hounds were scarcely discernible
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
he was right: they were returning and becoming
more and more distinct every minute. ‘Hoorah,’
he shouted in his exultation; ‘the otter must
have come up-water laast night; wheere’s he
lyin’, wonder.’ His eyes, almost starting from
his head, followed the pack as it drew nearer and
nearer to Moor Pool. They reached it; then he
was all anxiety to see whether they would take up
the tributary or keep to the river. Like a man
toeing the line for a foot-race he stood ready to
start, and if they had gone up the stream he
would have descended the hill at breakneck
speed; but they did not: they came on. ‘Niver
such a bit of luck in all my born days,’ said he,
his weather-beaten face beaming with delight.
Presently, as the deep bay, like the bay of bloodhounds,
reached his ears: ‘What moosic! how
wild and savage and grand it is! eh, and what a
sight for one pair of eyes! The squire’d give
gold to be in my shoes.’ Not for a single instant
did the harbourer divert his gaze from the pack.
‘Pretty, pretty,’ he kept saying as the hounds,
time after time, recovered the line momentarily
lost. ‘They’re travellin’ fast. It’s time to be
going down. I’ll lay a groat the otter’s in the
Kieve.’ With a bound he was off and, following
the overflow, had just reached the big boulder
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
from which the buzzard sometimes watched the
moor, when, to his surprise, he saw Dosmary
and Tuneful just beginning the ascent of the
hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Niver lyin’ up round the tarn! ’Tes ten year
agone since they found theere. However, here
they come, here the beauties come.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a strange tenderness in his voice,
but the light that leapt to his eyes told still more
plainly how he was stirred. He watched them
for a few moments, so that the whole pack was
in sight before he began retracing his steps, and
quickly as his sinewy legs carried him up the
steep, the hounds had passed him when he gained
the crest. Quivering with excitement, he stood
again for a moment with his eyes on them as
they streamed along the strand; then he tore
along in their wake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He might have covered twoscore yards, during
which the pack had swept round the end of the
tarn to the rocks, when a crash of music proclaimed
the find, and brought him up in his
stride. Soon the white-and-tan heads of the
leading hounds showed as they rounded the
point. One glance he gave them—only one:
then his eyes were all for the otter. Whilst he
watched the water well in front of the pack,
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
the otter rose, shook his head, rested until his
pursuers were within a few yards of him, and
dived, showing his back and rudder. ‘Takin’
things quietly, are ’ee?’ said the harbourer in
high glee; and then, presently, on observing the
hounds lick up the scent as they swam, ‘They’re
tonguing the ream brave.’ Scarcely were the
words out of his mouth, when up came the otter
within a few yards of him. The excited ‘Tally-ho!’
with which he greeted him made the welkin
ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <a id='squire2'></a>squire would always have it that he heard
the penetrating scream; but however that may
be, it was a good half-hour before he appeared
on the summit, and by that time the otter had
given the pack the slip and set the harbourer
wondering what had become of it. He was
amongst the reeds and hidden by the rocks when
the squire came up near the overflow, but his
cries, as he cheered the pack, betrayed his whereabouts,
and presently the squire hailed him across
the tarn: ‘Have you viewed the otter, my
man?’ ‘Iss, sir, over and over again, but he’s
creapt away somewheere out of mark.’ The
hounds raised their heads on hearing their
master’s voice, and when he sang out, ‘Seek
him, my lads! wind him, my lads!’ they bustled
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
about, searching along the foot of the cliff as if
they meant to find; and very soon they did find,
but in a place where neither hounds nor terrier
could reach the quarry. The doctor, who was
nearest, at once made his way to the spot where
the hounds were clamouring and, lying flat on
the ledge, succeeded in dislodging the game from
its retreat by means of the pole he carried.
Thus driven from his only refuge, the otter got
no rest. As a good scent guided the hounds,
the hunted creature’s only chance lay in wearying
out his pursuers. And what endurance he
showed! He dived hither and thither for over
three hours and never landed once; but all in
vain, the pack showed no signs of tiring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, in desperation, he slipped over the fall
into the pool below and passed down the stream,
searching for a hiding-place as he went. Soon
he reached the boulder from which the harbourer
had watched the hounds and, sighting the crevice
at its base, swam through the narrow opening to
the hollowed space within. Scarcely was he
ensconced when he heard the cry of his pursuers,
and a minute later the maddened creatures were
roaring at the mouth of his retreat. Squire and
followers came tearing down the hill, and when
the whipper-in had succeeded in calling off the
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
hounds, Venom, the terrier, was sent in to drive
the otter out. ‘He’ll soon have un out,’ said a
man in a blue guernsey who knew his worth.
But hard and game as the terrier was, the otter
was his match. So the squire must have thought,
for he determined to send Vic to his assistance.
As soon as she was released, the eager little
thing swam whining along the passage and
joined in the fight; but, owing to the cramped
quarters, instead of assisting her mate she
hampered him. Once the tip of the otter’s
rudder showed momentarily, raising the excitement
to fever-pitch; but this was followed by a
long spell during which not a hair of either
terrier or otter was visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘They’ll never drive un, squire,’ the <a id='wood2'></a>woodman
ventured to say. ‘Why not flood the varmint
out? Theere’s a good head of water.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Too good a head, I fear; but we’ll try. The
terriers have had about enough. Get ’em out if
you can.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Watching his opportunity, the woodman
managed to pull Vic out almost at once, and
Venom after a while. Both were terribly cut
up. The sight of their wounds angered the
squire, who at once called out: ‘Now, men,
build a dam, and look lively; that otter shan’t
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
live another hour.’ All set to work. Except
the whipper-in, who had as much as he could do
to look after the hounds, every man lent a hand.
Some brought big stones, others armfuls of
heather, others stone-crop stripped from the
rocks, whilst Geordie the gipsy, the parson, the
miller and the water-bailiff constructed the
dam. Under their eager hands the wall rose
steadily across the tail of the pool, and before
long the impounded stream began to creep inch
by inch up the face of the rock. In half an
hour the mouth of the holt was covered; soon,
too, the stone which had provided a resting-place
for the otter; so that he now was compelled
to plant his fore-feet against the wall to keep his
head above water. Still the water rose, and but
for the presence of the imprisoned air the hollow
would have been filled and the beast forced to
leave and meet its fate in the open. Yet, contracted
though the space became, there was a
small interval between the water and the roof,
and there the otter’s nostrils still found relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the men at the dam had all they
could do to hold the stream back; and presently,
despite their frantic efforts, the obstruction gave
way, and the whole mass rushed roaring down
the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
‘Don’t much matter, squire; the otter’s
drownded before this.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘May be; but will you put your hand in and
draw him out?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, thank ’ee,’ replied the <a id='mill2'></a>miller amidst the
loud laughter of the crowd. ‘Geordie’s the man
for that job.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I don’t mind trying, sir,’ said the gipsy, who
unhesitatingly approached the rock, knelt in the
water, put in his hand to the full length of his
arm, and began feeling blindly about the inside.
He had worked round three sides and reached
the corner to the right when the otter gripped
him by the ball of the thumb. His face, which
was half turned to the onlookers, must have
betrayed the pain he felt, for the woodman
called out: ‘Have ’ee got un, Geordie?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I don’t know about that,’ replied Geordie,
‘but he’s got me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly he drew the resisting creature towards
the aperture, but on being brought to the light
it let go, and allowed the man to rise to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Rather a nasty wound, Geordie,’ said the
squire, putting half a sovereign in the bleeding
palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Thank you, sir; ’tes only a scratch to some
I’ve had. I’ll have another try if you like, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
‘No, no, my man, not on any account. The
otter deserves his life. We’ll leave him for
another season, and I hope we may meet again.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little did he dream that the game beast which
had baffled his best efforts was to become the
talk of the country-side, and would for many a
day disappoint his hopes and flout his plans.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>THE OTTER AND HIS MATE</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rather more than a year has passed since the
hunt. The vegetation then in flower, after
blooming again, has lost its glory, and is now
withering and dying. In the <a id='marsh2'></a>marsh the reeds
are sapless, the flags stained by decay, the tall-stemmed
flowering plants shrivelled to skeletons,
disarray and discoloration appear everywhere,
save perhaps in the velvet spikes of the mace-reed,
whose hue yet rivals in its rich umber the
pelt of the otter curled up below them on the
spot where he lay in the days of rebellious cubhood.
But what a huge fellow he has grown!
Fine whelp though he was, he has developed
beyond all promise, and there is not an otter on
his rounds that can compare with him. He is
inches longer and pounds heavier even than his
father, and it is little wonder that he should have
attracted the notice of sportsmen and become
the talk of the country-side. For though since
he reached his prime no one has caught more
than a glimpse of him, yet keeper, bailiff and
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
moorman have all come on his footprints and
given such reports of their size that interest has
become widespread and people have flocked from
far and near to the meets in the hope of seeing
him found and hunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one was more interested than the <a id='squire3'></a>squire,
but he succeeded in concealing the excitement he
felt, unless, perhaps, it showed in his very caustic
language to the field at the least tendency to
press the hounds; and when the season ended
without the otter being accounted for, no one
save his wife and the old butler knew his disappointment.
But disappointed he was; and indeed
it was almost inexplicable that the hounds should
not have chanced on the otter, for he kept to the
usual trails and kennelled in the well-known
holts. Once they followed his line to the creek,
but there, owing to the rising tide, the pursuit
had to be abandoned. At another time they
actually drew over him where he lay far in under
the bank out of mark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet if he bore a charmed life to hunter and
hound, he was not fortunate enough to keep
quite clear of the other perils that beset him.
After having long avoided <a id='trap2'></a>traps set here and
there on his path, he was caught when about
fourteen months old by a gin laid in a shallow,
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
and he carried the cruel engine about with him
for three days before the chain became so entangled
in an alder-root that he was able to
wrench himself free. Soon after he was shot
at by old Ikey, the wild-fowler, in the channel
connecting the Big and the Little Liddens. His
quickness in diving at the flash alone saved him,
for the man was a dead shot. One night he
came on a gang of <a id='poach1'></a>poachers <a id='burn'></a>‘burning the reed’
in the pool below the morass, and stood to watch
them, fascinated by the flare that lit up the
excited faces bending over the water. But
though scared by the sight of his enemies, he
went only a short distance out of his way to
avoid them, and soon after was chasing a salmon
in <a id='pool3'></a>Moor Pool, killing in time to make a hurried
meal and reach the tarn before dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long, arduous and generally vain was his
pursuit of the fresh-run fish; but, mighty hunter
that he was, he was successful now and then,
and enjoyed a hard-earned feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after such an achievement that the
<a id='bail1'></a>bailiff stood a-stare at his tracks, and shouted to
the miller to come down to him. ‘What do ’ee
think of it?’ he asked. ‘Think of it?’ said the
miller, who had noticed only the remains of the
otter’s banquet, ‘think of it? You didn’t holloa
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
like that for an old fish, did ’ee? I thought
somebody was drow——’ Before he could finish
the word he saw and, understanding, added in a
changed tone: ‘Well, well, they prents beat all
I ever did see. I’d give a sack of bests to clap
eyes on the varmint as left ’em. Where’s a lyin’,
wonder. Anywheres handy, do ’ee think?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘It’s a safe offer you’re making, William
Richard. You’ll nae see the canny vagabond
the day. He’s no couching near the kill, I’m
thinking, but miles and miles awa’—at Lone
Tarn, maybe, or by the Leeddens. That print’—and
he pointed to a footmark half in and half
out of the water—‘seems to say he was travelling
up-water.’</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span class='it'>Photo W. S. Berridge, F.Z.S.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To face p. 108.<br/><br/><span class='bold'>ON HIS WAY UP THE CREEK.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The bailiff was right in supposing that the
otter had sought a distant couch, but wrong as
to the direction it took and its whereabouts. At
that moment the animal was curled up asleep in
Rundle’s oak coppice overhanging the estuary,
ten miles away as the river winds. The next day
he was in the bat-cave, but he had not come to
stay. At night he was off again, nor did he arrest
his steps save to fish and call along the lonely
reaches which led to the swamp he was bound for,
a good league beyond the bridge. Indeed, he was
always on the move, seeming to think it unsafe
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
to sleep two successive days in the same hover.
In one fastness, however, he was content to linger—the
<a id='head1'></a>headland between the Gull Rock and the
<a id='shark'></a>Shark’s Fin. There he would stay for days
together, held by the drear solitude, the supply of
fish, and the snug lying in the caves that honeycombed
the cliff, where man never came, and
where, whether the wind blew from the east or
from the west, the otter, who disliked exposure to
it as much as any fox, could always find a recess
on the lee side to shelter in. He took no notice
of the tolling of the bell that marked the reef on
which he often landed, and the only thing that
drove him away was the flooding of his hovers
by tempestuous seas. This at last made him
seek the drain in the island of the squire’s pond
the day before he came to the marsh, sharing it
with two other dog-otters, refugees like himself.
At dusk he foraged along-shore despite the heavy
ground seas, and at peep of day returned to his
old couch at the foot of the reeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To see him lying there no one would dream
that he lived in fear of his life. His breathing is
placid, his limbs are quiet; no whimper, telling
of disturbing dreams, escapes his lips; the very
lapdog on the hearth might be more troubled
than he. Nor does he seem to be the ferocious
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
beast he is till he raises his head and peers suspiciously
through the stems; then the fierce,
restless eyes proclaim him a savage and an outlaw
as he scans bar and cliff and creek. On the
bare patch on the hillside his glance rests a
moment—one would say the removal of the
furze was a matter of concern to him; but soon,
apparently satisfied, he falls to grooming the
glossy coat which is his pride. He bestows
much care on the massive fore-limbs and on the
huge, splayed feet whose prints have stirred the
imagination of the neighbourhood. A bit of fur
on his grey waistcoat not being all he would have
it, he licks it again and again; and so the afternoon
passes, till the starlings come flying in to
roost, the shadows creep over the furze, and the
mists gather on the mere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When night had quite closed in, he rose,
slipped into the water and, coming up a good
gunshot away, swam rapidly towards the beach.
In the shallows he turned his mask as if to make
sure the mist harboured no enemy, and then took
across the bar, spurning the pebbles and seaweed
as he ran. At the edge of the tide he looked
back again, but as nothing met his eyes save the
ridge and the stars that shone above it, he moved
leisurely down the shelving strand, plunged into
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
the curl of the wave, came up in the rough water
beyond, made straight for the fishing-ground
some two furlongs from the shore, dived, and
began scouring the sand and the rocks that
chequered it. He looked more like a <a id='cong1'></a>conger
than a beast of prey; yet the fish were quick to
recognize their dreaded enemy, and darted from
his path. Of sand-eels and flat-fish he took no
heed, but gave chase to a bass, pursuing it till it
was lost to sight in the depths beyond; then, his
lungs being exhausted, he shot up through the
seven fathoms of water and lay awhile on the
surface, now in the trough, now in the crest of
the wave, with his face towards the moon, which
had risen clear of the headland. He seemed to
be listening, perhaps to the booming in the caves
or to the tolling of the bell on the Shark’s Fin,
but more probably to the surf about the <a id='sealr1'></a>Seal
Rock, for presently he swam towards this
favourite landing-place. Within a stone’s throw
of it, however, he dived, and made his way in
a spiral down and down until he reached the
mouth of a cave in the base of the great pyramid
of which the rock is the peak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew the place well, for he had been
worsted there by a conger some months before,
and he had come now in quest of the same fish.
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
His head was scarcely through the weeds that
half screened the entrance when he sighted his
enemy, who on the instant retreated to its
stronghold in the wall of the cave. There,
quicker than it takes to tell, each fastened on the
other. Matched in weight and strength as they
were, it is doubtful whether the otter would have
got the mastery even in the open: in the conger’s
own retreat the attempt was hopeless. But the
otter did not realize that, and made frantic efforts
to drag the fish from its den. Despite them all he
failed to move it a single inch, and the only result
of his struggles was to free himself from the
conger’s jaws. When his breath was all but
exhausted he relinquished his hold and turned to
go. Thereupon the conger, taking the offensive,
made a grab at him; it tried to seize him again
near the mouth of the cave to which it pursued
him, but in both cases it failed to get a grip of
the slippery skin, and the next minute the otter
was at the surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not done with his antagonist. As
soon as his lungs were refilled, he dived again,
and in a trice was back in the cave, face to face
with his enemy, this time with tactics sobered by
experience. Instead of laying hold of the fish, he
kept making feints at it and retreating, with the
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
object of enticing it into the open; but the wily
conger never budged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the otter examined the wall of the cave
in the hope of getting at the fish from behind,
where the powerful tail gripped the rock. There
was no way in, however, and again the baulked
marauder had to ascend to take breath. Three
times more he made his way down to the mouth
of the den, dodging to and fro within a foot of
the dull green motionless eyes; but in the end
he gave up hope and left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he rose to the surface the last time he
seized a <a id='poll'></a>pollack with such eagerness that his
teeth met through it, and this he took to the
rock and devoured. Then, swimming towards
the shore, he fished along the cliffs, catching
<a id='wrasse2'></a>wrasse which he left uneaten on the weed-covered
ledges where he landed, till at length, tired of
wanton destruction, he entered the clitter, and
after a long interval came out on the topmost
boulder, gained the crest of the cliff, and so
crossed to the creek. There he cruised restlessly
from bank to bank, raising himself at times half
out of the water and looking round as if in search
of something. Presently he took to the furze
brake that mantles the slope and, traversing the
bare patch, passed up the misty valley, only to
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
return to the sand-hills beyond the cottage, where,
like an embodied spirit of unrest, he wandered
from dune to dune, repeating at times the shrill
whistle he had already sounded from the Seal
Rock and the bends of the stream that winds
along the valley, and standing with raised head
pointed now this way, now that, to listen. Once
he thought he heard an answering call, but
presently discovered his error, and from that
moment gave over calling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he spent the hours of the long night
before returning to his lair, where he busied
himself in cleansing his lips and whiskers of the
slime that adhered to them and smoothing the
patches of his coat, disarranged by the conger’s
jaws. He was long over his toilet, but longer
still in falling asleep: the recollection of his
defeat kept him awake and caused the hair to
rise on his neck as it had risen on the neck of
his father at the thought of the pike of Lone
Tarn, so that the sun had climbed to half its
height before he drowsed and forgot his troubles.
Consequently it was late when he bestirred himself
and took to the mere, where another dog-otter
was already fishing. For a long time each
was ignorant of the other’s presence, but at last
chance brought them together, and as the
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
stranger flashed by, the otter saw that both ears
were torn and that he was otherwise scarred by
fighting. Later the two animals passed and
repassed one another on the surface, and towards
dawn, when the otter made for his couch, the
new-comer crossed the beach towards the cliffs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night the otter, whilst calling from the
Seal Rock, heard a rival call from far away across
the water in the direction of the Shark’s Fin.
Later the cry came from the cliffs below Cold
Comfort Farm, and close on cockcrow from the
clitter where he himself had called an hour before.
Every minute he expected the stranger to round
the bluff and cross the bar, and presently he saw
him come over the pebble ridge and slip into the
mere. It was the otter of the night before, who
passed down the creek, landed opposite the island,
and lay up under the furze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At nightfall both otters, apparently on good
terms, were fishing near the inflow, when the
shrill summons of a female reached their ears
and set them aflame with passion. They swam
as fast as their legs could propel them to the
spot whence the call proceeded, and as soon as
the otter had landed and licked the face of the
skittish little creature awaiting the rivals, he
turned to face his enemy. Like two furies they
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
fought in the shallows churned with their incessant
movements. <a id='fight2'></a>As they struggled they got
into deeper water, where, locked together, they
sank beneath the surface, and so long did they
remain immersed that it seemed as though both
must be drowned. But the eddies by some
decaying lilies told that the fight was still going
on, and at last the beasts came up, it might be a
yard apart. Quick as lightning they closed again
and, rolling over and over, passed from sight a
second time in the convulsed water. Then they
half rose, and lashing the water with their powerful
tails, kept snapping at each other with a
viciousness that nothing could exceed, their
savage snarls mingling with the clash of their
teeth when they failed to get home. For over
an hour the conflict raged, now above, now below
the surface, till in the end, the old otter, unable
to continue the battle, dived to escape further
mauling from his victorious foe. But the wild
creature’s jealousy is never appeased unless its
rival is utterly worsted; and a relentless pursuit
followed. The bitch otter, now all ears as she
had been all eyes, heard the landing, first of the
fugitive, then of his enraged pursuer, and soon
the crashing of the stems that told of further
conflict. At length, in the silence that succeeded
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
the noise of strife, she saw the victor emerge
from the mist as he swam towards the spot
where she awaited him. Thus, by the discomfiture
of the tyrant who had been the terror of
every young dog-otter on his rounds, the otter
won the little mate who was to share his lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happier than they were, two otters could not
be. Their close companionship proved it. Where
one was, there was the other. They fished in
company, they hovered together, and when they
journeyed to fresh fishing-grounds they travelled
side by side. A fortnight after they had paired
they made their way up the valley of the stream
that supplies the mere, and laid up in holts
known to the female otter. Three nights’ fishing
and roaming brought them to the great <a id='quag2'></a>quagmire
where the stream rises, which in summer is but
a thread of water winding through the waste of
cotton grasses that nod over it. All day they
lay asleep on dry <a id='couch2'></a>couches in the heart of the
mire, and at dusk the female led over the high
ridge to the watershed that slopes to the northern
cliffs where she had been reared. The stream
they followed empties itself near a hamlet, and
there in the cove under the very windows they
fished until daybreak drove them to the cave
where they intended to hover. Shaking their
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
coats, they entered—to find an otter already in
possession. The instant he raised his mask they
saw it was he of the scarred face, but before they
advanced a yard he had risen to his feet and was
in full flight towards another outlet. The influence
of the fight was still on him, and he
preferred retreat, even by daylight, to risk of
another mauling. They never saw him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The otters stayed in the neighbourhood of the
hamlet over a week, and during their sojourn
nothing disturbed them, nothing even made them
prick their ears, except the creaking of the oars
as the fishermen rowed past their quarters. On
leaving they moved westwards, and beyond two
wild headlands came at dawn to the beetling cliffs
where the <a id='seal2'></a>seals have their dwelling in vast
caverns hollowed by the Atlantic. Swimming
through the turmoil of water at the narrow
mouth of the nearest <a id='cave3'></a>cave, they landed half-way
in, climbed to a ledge, from that to another
higher still, and there lay down on the bare rock
and licked themselves, pausing now and again to
look at the seals reclining on the beach of white
sand that loomed in the darkness shrouding the
inmost part of the cave. When they had completed
their toilet they curled up on the smooth
slab and, being weary after their long swim, fell
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
asleep, despite the incessant cries of the seals and
the ceaseless roar of the waves. They did not
awake till the last rays of the sun illumined the
surf at the cave’s mouth; but when the <a id='shag'></a>shags
came flying in to roost, they bestirred themselves,
and presently sallied out to fish on the edge of
the tide-race and gambol in the swirls of the
boiling eddies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They used the cave for nearly a week, until
tempted by the very fine weather to lie out.
Then for three days they hovered in the basin at
the summit of the <a id='pill'></a>Pillar Rock, about a furlong
from the cliffs, their presence known only to the
gulls and gannets that sailed overhead. On
resuming their round, they came, after four hours’
journeying, to the beach of the Gulf Stream
fronting the west, and there they fished and
frolicked amongst the waves that broke on the
shelly strand, and sought couches amongst the
sea-rushes that tuft the dunes. They lingered
there week after week till the weather changed,
but on the night of a lurid sunset, rounded the
grim promontory which marks the end of all the
land, and set their faces towards <a id='marsh3'></a>the marsh. On
the way thither the female otter kept biting off
the rushes and carrying them in her mouth, and
when she reached the mere she at once chose a
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
place in the heart of the reed-bed to make a nest.
From it soon proceeded the faint squeals of four
baby otters, the rearing of which, as it proved,
was to try the resources of herself and her mate
to the utmost.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>FROST AND FAMINE</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the night on which the whelps were born
the otter repaired to his old hover on the point,
whence he could slip into the water by day and,
without exposing himself, catch what fish his
mate needed to make good the drain on her
strength. In going to and from the spot near
the nest where he left his takings for her he soon
beat a path amongst the reeds, by which the
little mother reached the mere at nightfall and
joined her mate in raiding the fish that seemed
more abundant than ever. Eels indeed were
scarce since the autumn migration, but of pike,
tench and bream there was great store. On
these the otters fed for the most part; but occasionally
they fished in the sea, and took toll of
the pollack, plaice, conger and shell-fish found in
the inshore waters. They could not have wished
for greater variety of prey, and the supply seemed
as assured as it was inexhaustible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was soon to steal upon the unsuspecting
creatures a frost which exceeded in
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
severity any visitation of cold that even the old
marshman had witnessed. It set in whilst the
cubs were yet blind, and on the second night the
water near the nest was frozen thick enough to
bear the otter’s weight, as were also the shallows
near the bar, for he landed on the ice there to
eat his supper. Before many days passed, strings
of wild-fowl arrived, causing great rejoicing to
the otters, who, far from regarding them as harbingers
of famine, foresaw an agreeable change
in their usual fish diet. Nor had they occasion
to look with apprehension on the gradual encroachment
of the ice, inasmuch as the <a id='holes'></a>breathing-holes
which they made and kept open enabled
them to range as freely as before the frost. Of
course, they had to bring their prey to the open
water; but for the trouble this gave them they
found some compensation in the convenient landing-place
afforded by the edge of the ice, which
was soon dotted with the remains of their repasts.
Moreover, the great sheet of ice served them as
a playground when they were weary of gambolling
in the mere, and on it they cut mad capers
which held the mallard, widgeon, and teal at gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Protected by their thick coats the creatures
enjoyed the biting cold, and the cubs, cuddled
together in the cosy nest, suffered no ill effects
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
from its rigour. The <a id='pike3'></a>pike, like the otters,
revelled in the frost; but the tench, and the
<a id='eels2'></a>eels that had not gone to sea, felt its pinch, and
the bream forsook their usual feeding-grounds.
Where these gregarious fish had betaken themselves
the otters never knew, but the eels and
tench buried themselves in the mud and gave
much trouble in the capture. Still, disagreeable
though the process was, both these fish were to
be had by patient searching in the ooze—at least,
it was so at first; then the ground ice, which had
gripped the stems of the weeds, spread and spread
as the cold increased, until it formed an impenetrable
layer over most of the bed of the mere.
This followed on the withdrawal of the sea-fish
to the warmer depths of the offing, inaccessible
to the otters, which were thus caused no little
uneasiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the closing of the breathing-holes however
a few days later that seriously alarmed
them, all but costing the dog-otter his life; for,
never dreaming that he would be unable to
reopen them at will as heretofore and get the air
he needed, he made without misgiving for the
best hunting-ground, far in beneath the ice-field,
and after capturing a pike, swam unconcernedly
to the nearest vent-hole. A single bump of his
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
head, hitherto sufficient, failing to break the
crust, he delivered two more blows in quick succession;
and when these proved of no effect, he
saw his danger, and hurried to the next vent-hole,
hard by a frozen-in <a id='trim'></a>trimmer. One blow,
and only one, did he give; then he dropped the
pike, and with lightning-like strokes of his
powerful hind-legs made for the open water. It
was a race for life, and he knew it. His lungs
ached for want of air; again and again in the
next few seconds—seconds that seemed hours—he
was on the point of opening his mouth and
throat to find an impossible relief, but he forbore,
holding on his desperate way, till presently he
shot from under the ice-roof and drew breath
again in the frosty air. He had escaped drowning,
but only to be confronted the very next
night with difficulties even more aggravated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cold had then reached its greatest intensity.
The <a id='man2'></a>marshman was conscious of its severity
as he sat by the fire, listening to the <a id='geese'></a>honking of
the geese and the trumpeting of the <a id='wild'></a>swans—rare
sounds, that were music to the aged wild-fowler,
and kept him to the chimney-corner later than
his wont. Yet at daybreak he was at his lattice
to get a view of the overnight arrivals. To his
amazement, not a living thing could he see. He
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
rubbed the pane, he rubbed his eyes, and looked
again; then he realized—what he had never seen
before—that the mere was completely frozen.
Despite the depth of the water, the current, and
the restless movements of the wild-fowl, the frost
had had its way; the vast sheet was one continuous
field of steel-blue ice. The otters had
witnessed the sealing of the mere, had watched
the ducks, geese and swans take wing and melt
into the night, before they realized their desperate
situation; then, had the cubs been able to travel,
they would at once have turned their back on
the marshland, as the wild-fowl had done, and
made across country for the salmon river, where
fish crowded the spawning-beds. But as yet the
cubs could only sprawl, and to carry them over
the miles of moorland that lay between or to
attempt to reach it by way of the sea and the
estuary was out of the question; they had no
choice but to stay and face the famine that
threatened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As yet they had not suffered at all; indeed,
they had caught more fish than they needed, and
for their leavings the <a id='fox4'></a>hill-foxes regularly visited
the ice. Amongst them was a poor, half-starved
vixen, who, along with the otters, witnessed the
ice meet across the strait of open water. Thin
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
as she was, her lot was preferable to that of the
otter, with cubs wholly dependent on her; for it
seemed impossible to support them unless the
frost should soon relent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shut off from the mere and the stream that
fed it, the night after the closing of the ice the
otters turned to the land and quested wherever
cover afforded prospect of finding prey. They
threaded the reeds and furze-brake, they drew
the two osier-beds and tussocky ground between
them, but met with nothing save a few dead
starlings, from whose sorry skeletons they turned
away, hungry though they were. On the next
night the hard-set creatures made their way
along the stream until they came to the solitary
homestead in the heart of the western moor.
There they left the ice, clambered up the high
bank, and climbed the farmyard wall to the
cart-shed, where, standing on their hind-legs, they
examined the crannies in the wall for snails, but
found none. Coming out, they skirted the pigsty,
passed between an alder-tree and the lighted
window, and just as they rounded the corner of
the house, found themselves almost face to face
with a white cat. Savage tom though he was,
he never thought of fighting. In a twinkling he
was in full retreat, with both otters at his heels.
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
The male was the faster, and he pressed the cat
very closely across the small garden in front of
the house, through a gap in the wall, and along
the strip of field at the side. He must have
overtaken it before reaching the gate had not the
cat suddenly swerved and gained a couple of feet,
maintaining the lead until it passed through the
hole in the stable door at the upper end of the
farmyard. The otter followed. Scarcely were
they out of sight when the female otter came up
the yard on their scent, and also passed in
through the aperture at the foot of the door. A
fearful spitting ensued, and immediately the cat
reappeared with the male so close behind that
his nose all but touched the big fluffed-out
brush. At a desperate pace both sped over the
frozen dung-heap towards the alder-tree; the cat
swarmed up, despite the efforts of the otter to
seize it, and from its safe perch amongst the topmost
branches sat looking down at both otters,
from whose nostrils the breath issued like jets of
steam. Presently the blazing up of the furze
fire within drew the eyes of the otters to the
window, and when a shadow fell on the blind
they slunk away, followed the rude cart-track to
the boundary of the farm, and struck straight
across the moor in the direction of the <a id='lidd2'></a>Liddens.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
A bitter wind swept the waste, but they held
on in the teeth of it, crossed the frozen pools, and
headed for the mere. On reaching it the female
otter made straight for the nest, where she lay
oppressed with the dread of famine, till fatigue
had its way and sleep made her deaf to the
plaints of her unfed cubs. At dusk she and her
mate foraged alongshore and found a few <a id='limp'></a>limpets,
on which they managed to keep themselves and
the whelps from starving until the supply failed.
Then the little mother, driven to extremity,
dulled the gnawing pangs of hunger with seaweed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the famine under which parents and whelps
were wasting was presently added the outlawed
creature’s most treacherous enemy—a fall of
snow. It began one morning soon after they
had sought their couches, and did not cease until
a thick covering lay on the marsh and on the
hills about it. That night the otters again
foraged along the coast, but nothing passed their
lips save a few more limpets and a little water
from the runnel which still trickled in the cave
behind the clitter. Yet, distressed as they were,
they rolled and gambolled on the snow in the
heart of the mere, whence the tell-tale trails
diverged, ready to betray their whereabouts to
the first comer. Some hours later, however,
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
more snow fell, obliterating the tracks, and
spreading a coverlet over mother and young
where they slumbered in the deep nest. The
mother’s light sleep was broken by the creaking
of the windlass over the well and the quacking
of the marshman’s ducks, but both sounds, under
the muffling effect of the snow, seemed to come
from far beyond the cottage. The quacking of
the ducks was so tantalizing to the famished
creature that she actually left the nest and, with
just the arch of her back showing above the
snow, stole towards the spot whence the noise
proceeded. On and on she forged her way, and
actually advanced to within gunshot of the
duck-house. Then her courage failed her, and
caused her to retreat along the furrow she had
made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was afoot again at early nightfall, joined
her mate and followed him to the shore. After
they had fished far and wide to no purpose
she turned to him with a distracted look that
meant, ‘Whither now?’ For answer he shifted
his gaze from her face towards the cottage; and
when, after some hesitation, he moved towards
it, she understood, and took her place at his
heels. They passed very near the nest—near
enough indeed to catch, despite the loud rustling
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
of the reeds, the plaints of the cubs. On hearing
the pitiful cries, the mother, her maternal instincts
stirred, quickened her pace in a succession
of leaps that gave her the lead, which she maintained
until the sight of the cottage brought her
to a standstill and her mate to her side; then,
with their necks raised like little watch-towers,
their keen eyes reconnoitred the enemy’s dwelling.
Nobody stirred, no light showed; the
whistling wind favoured them; all seemed propitious,
and they drew near the duck-house.
Within a few yards of the door they suddenly
halted, turning their heads towards the cottage.
But it was a needless alarm; the noise that
scared them was only the scraping of the wall by
the branch of a medlar-tree. The instant they
discovered the cause of their hesitation they
stepped forward, and put their noses to the crack
at the bottom of the door. The scent of the
birds within nearly drove the starving creatures
mad. But how were they to get at them?
Though only a wooden partition separated them
from the savoury prey, it was enough. They
never thought of biting through it; to crawl
under or dig their way in was impossible, and
the aperture at the top seemed out of their reach.
Nevertheless, this opening was their only chance
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
of entrance; and frantic were the efforts they
made to obtain a hold on the top of the door.
More than once the otter all but succeeded; had
his claws been long and sharp instead of short
and blunted, he would have got a footing and
probably an entry. But the door rattled and
creaked with their futile attempts, and the noise,
with the quacking of the terror-stricken ducks,
reached the ears of the <a id='man3'></a>marshman as he lay listening
to the gale. Old and stiff though he was, it
was the work of a moment to jump out of bed,
open the lattice, and shout at the top of his voice.
At the sound the guilty creatures stole away in
the direction of the big osier-bed; yet their lot
was so desperate that when they neared the furze-rick
the little mother stopped and looked back.
Despite her dread of the marshman, she would
have returned to the duck-house had her mate
been willing; but whilst she stood he kept on,
and presently she followed and overtook him.
It was with weary steps they plodded forward,
hopeless as two otters can be. Whither could
they turn? Not to the hills, whence even a <a id='pole'></a>polecat
had come to the marsh to forage; not to the
cliffs nor inshore waters; they knew them only
too well. And so with no goal to make for, the
luckless creatures passed into the night.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>TRACKED</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day had scarcely broken when the old marshman
came bustling out of his cottage to see
whether the fox—as he supposed the marauder
to be—had carried off any of his ducks. Before
he had crossed the little garden, however, he
descried the snow-marks on the door and, from
their size, judged them to be made by a badger,
till his eyes fell on the unmistakable trail outside
the gate, which placed the raiders’ identity
beyond all possible doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oters! Lor, whoever would ha’ thought it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, as he remembered that the mere was
frozen and the creatures shut off from the water,
the expression of surprise changed to one of
triumph, and forgetting for a moment his decrepitude,
he exultingly exclaimed: ‘They’re
mine—sure as eggs, they’re mine!’ It was not
their destruction that elated him, but the prospect—the
almost certain prospect—of securing
their pelts, and of adding a sovereign to the
dwindling store in the thatch.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
Of course, before he could dispose of the skins
he must find the otters, and shoot them when
found; but what could be easier, he thought,
than to track them down with such a trail; and
then even he, old and infirm though he was,
could hardly fail to hit the long-bodied creatures
as they left their couches and floundered through
the snow. So easy did the task seem in the first
flush of excitement, before the difficulties presented
themselves, crowding upon him as if to
shake him from his purpose. The bitterness of
the wind, the depths of the drifts, the possibility—nay,
the probability, of the creatures having
sought the cliffs, his own physical debility: all
confronted him, but only to be made light of and
swept aside before he turned and hobbled back
to the cottage, determined at all costs to make
the attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On crossing the threshold he went straight to
the hearth, his eyes raised to the two guns and
a brass <a id='blund'></a>blunderbuss that rested on wooden pegs
above it. The <a id='flint'></a>flintlock was within easy reach;
but it was the modern gun he meant to use and,
standing on tiptoe, he managed to grasp the
hammers and take it down. A little over a year
before, when he had put the wonderful piece
there, he thought he should never use it again,
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
never dreaming of such an easy chance as that
offered by otters on the snowed-up mere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Can I hold straight enow, wonder.’ ‘Iss,
sure,’ came the complacent answer; ‘you can
hold straight enow for that.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, as if conscious that he could not
and fearing to put his enfeebled powers to the
test, he kept blowing on the barrels, though
all the dust had gone, until at last, remembering
the dark, snow-laden sky, he raised the stock to
his shoulder, shut one eye, and looked along the
gun. In his younger days man and weapon
might have been molten together in bronze, so
steadily could he stand and hold; but now, as
he had dreaded, the sight zig-zagged over the
pane when he aimed at a starling on the medlar-tree
outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘’Tis no use; couldn’t hit a seal, leave alone
an oter, with muzzle wobblin’ all over the place
like that—dear, dear, oh, dear!’ and he sank into
the corner of the settle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he sat before the furze fire which
a girl was tending, warmth came back to his
hands, the thought of the golden sovereign
quickened his blood, and he resolved to make a
second attempt. Rising to his feet, he again
raised the gun to his shoulder and, holding his
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
breath, aimed at the bird still bunched up on the
swaying branch. As the sight kept fairly true
to the mark, confidence returned, the old man’s
face brightened, and resting the weapon against
the table, he set about his preparations. He
fetched from a drawer in the dresser powder-flask,
shot-pouch, caps and wads; he loaded both
barrels, and replaced the ramrod. Then he
turned up the collar of his worn velveteen coat,
pulled the badger-skin cap over his ears and,
telling the child he should not be away long,
sallied out with the gun at half-cock under his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trail led past the frozen-in <a id='boat2'></a>boat towards
the tossing withy-bed, but just before reaching it,
swerved unexpectedly, as if the creatures had
caught a glimpse of some forager who had forestalled
them, or had all at once thought it best
to make without delay for the farther side of the
marsh. Bending his bowed figure as he turned,
the old man set his face to the gale and plodded
bravely along by the side of the tracks, the snow
in places reaching half-way up his leather leggings.
The depth of it made him hopeful that the otters
had not gone far before lying up; so, as he drew
near each bit of cover that offered harbourage,
he raised the hammers and held the gun at the
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
ready. He did this again and again, whilst beating
the tussocky ground on the farther bank of
the stream, where the otters had stayed to quest
before crossing the unbroken expanse of snow
that stretched to the foot of the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At every stride now he was getting more and
more under shelter of the land; every score yards
the snow was becoming appreciably deeper and
deeper, until at last it lay in a <a id='snow'></a>big drift that
threatened to bar his way. A break in the
embankment, fluted and escalloped by the wind,
showed where the otters had tunnelled their way
through; and the old man, sanguine as to their
near neighbourhood, after blowing on his numbed
fingers, tightened his grip on the barrels and
determined to follow. As the drift was formidable
enough to daunt a younger and a taller man,
he twice shrank from committing himself to the
smothering mass. But again the thought of the
golden sovereign, now as he believed so nearly
his, lured him on: he held the gun above his
head, went at the yielding obstacle, sank in it,
disappeared all but hand and gun, fought with it,
and at last battled through. Furiously brushing
the snow out of his eyes, he looked eagerly to
right and to left, thinking the game was afoot
and striving to escape; but among the laid reeds
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
that met his gaze no living thing stirred: only
the big and the little trails, as plain as under the
wall of the duck-house, wound in and out
amongst the stems, trending in the direction of
the mere. ‘No hurry, my beauties; I shall come
up wi’ ’ee by-and-by;’ and snap, snap, went the
brittle reeds as he made his slow way through
them. He kept looking eagerly ahead as though
he expected to catch sight of the game retreating
before his noisy advance, but nothing caught
his eye save the wing of a moorhen on which
some fortunate forager had broken his fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet though he saw nothing of the otters themselves,
he came on evidence in the snow which
told him they had not spent the night wholly in
wandering. Between the reeds and the creek
were the beaten places where they had rolled,
and a gunshot farther, the slope down which
they had slid. On sighting the slide he stopped,
astonished that famine-stricken creatures, as he
knew they must be, could waste a moment in
gambols. ‘Most playsomest critturs on God’s
eerth,’ said he; but at once resumed his murderous
errand, now with grave misgivings lest he
should presently discover that the otters had kept
straight on to the bar and cliffs, and got beyond
his reach. He was greatly elated, therefore, on
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
reaching the furzy foreland, to find that his fears
were groundless, that the otters, instead of crossing
the mouth of the creek, had rounded the
point and passed up the inlet; for so he felt sure
of coming upon them, and most probably in the
nearer of the two likeliest holts towards which,
whenever he peeped from under the sheltering
peak of his cap, the gleaming eyes were directed.
It was the ancient <a id='pollard'></a>pollard whence he had twice
seen an otter steal away as he sculled past the
island on which it grew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘They’re theere right enow,’ the old man said
when he saw the trail turn that way, and raising
both hammers to full cock, he went on with a
stealth he had not before thought necessary. As
he reached the island he lost the tracks under the
snow-laden tangle. This he proceeded to beat
thoroughly; but as he did not really expect to
find the quarry there, presently he ceased trampling,
looked towards the hollow trunk where he
believed they were, called out, ‘Harkin’, are ’ee?’
crept as close to the bole as he dared, and peeped
through the cleft. He was obliged to keep at
some little distance to get a fair shot when they
bolted; and screw his eyes and crane his neck as
he might, it was impossible to distinguish the
dark bodies in the gloomy recess. He felt sure
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
however they were there, and it occurred to
him he might dislodge them with a snowball.
Taking up a cake of snow that bore the impress
of his hobnailed soles, he made two balls, which
he hurled in quick succession through the opening.
The second was scarcely out of his hand
before he picked up the gun he had laid down,
and stood ready to shoot the animals as they
escaped; but still no otter showed. ‘Not theere
after all, s’pose,’ said he; yet he advanced on
tiptoe to the tree, kicked it, and jumped back
with an agility that showed his expectations
were not quite exhausted. Again there was no
response: nothing stirred except the snow that
fell from the rickety crown. Then he walked up
to the tree, and peering through the crack,
examined the dusky shell from root to branch to
find nothing save an old nest with fish-bones on
the ground beside it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Convinced at last that the otters really were
not there, he proceeded to make a cast beyond
the island, using the gun to steady him as he
crossed some exposed ice to the snow. There
the sight of the trail brought home to him
his want of prevision, and threw him into a
rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Drat my stupid old head, why didn’t I ring
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
the eyot afore?’ came the quick, hot words.
‘Once bit, twice shy,’ he growled, and strode
from bank to bank in search of a return trail
which would prevent his being fooled again.
But neither on the open snow nor amongst the
reeds was there a sign that the otters had broken
back. On regaining the track he advanced along
it, confident now that the creatures were lying up
at the end of the creek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘At laist, and worth all the trouble. In pride
of pelt they’ll be. Take your time mind, aim
for the head, and the big un fust.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nearer he got to the end of the inlet,
the more agitated he became, until, on reaching
the spot where the otters had passed in
single file between two tussocks before entering
the brambles, he was in a fever of agitation. But
despite his excitement, the precautions he took
showed he had got himself well in hand, that he
was anxious to make the most of his hardly-earned
chance. He raised the flaps of his cap
that no sound might escape his ears; he brushed
away every particle of snow from the barrels of
the gun, and to satisfy himself that the weapon
would not miss fire, he raised the copper caps and
saw that the powder was still up in the nipples.
Then, everything being ready, he began to
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
trample upon the matted sprays in order to
drive the otters from their last possible retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had taken some half a dozen steps when a
patch of snow falling from the brambles well in
front informed him that something was afoot.
On the instant he stopped to listen, whilst his
restless eyes sought the likely points of escape,
and the gun shook in his nervous hands. As
the otters did not show, he felt sure they were
stealing away before him, and carefully watched
some reeds into which they must pass on leaving
the thicket. Seeing a slight agitation in the
stems, he tore like a madman through the rest of
the scrub, and stood at the edge ready to shoot.
But, too excited to await the otters’ pleasure, after
the briefest delay he advanced again, not however
with the reckless strides of a few moments
before, but with gingerly tread, as if now that
the supreme moment had come he was apprehensive
of dislodging the creatures he was so
eager to kill. He had taken a few cautious steps
when there was a slight rustling; then, to his
dismay, a <a id='bitt'></a>bittern rose and flew down the creek.
Up went the gun, the fore-finger found, but did
not pull, the trigger; and the bird escaped
without further scare. It was a terrible disappointment,
under which the old man collapsed.
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
The gun fell from his shoulder; his jaw dropped;
the eyes, but an instant before full of fire, were
dull and listless. He seemed inches shorter as
he staggered through the reeds and along the
gully towards a small enclosure about which the
banks rose almost sheer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Niver can be in the <a id='pisk'></a>Piskies’ Parlour to be
sure; and yet how could they get out?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were scarcely out of his mouth
when his eyes fell on the fresh marks against the
face of the scarp. Then he saw the footprints
left on the snow by the otters as they sprang
to the lowest ledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Has the frost touched my brain, or the little
folks my eyes? Nonsense! nothin’ of the kind;
thee’rt seein’ things as they are. Well, well,’
he went on after drawing a long breath, ‘I’ve
been wanderin’ about the ma’sh for wellnigh
fifty year, and come on many tracks, but never
prents like these. Lor mercy! must be a mighty
big varmint as left ’em. What a catch if only I
could ha’ bagged un!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of the footprints had put fresh life
into him; he determined to follow as far as he
could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’m bone-tired, but I’ll see it through if I
drop on the track.’</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
Only a cat could follow where the otters had
climbed; so he made his way back to the creek
and clambered up the high bank to the wind-swept
ridge leading to the cliffs. A forlorn
figure the old man looked as he fought his way
in the teeth of the gale to the brink of the
precipice, only to find the trail end on a slab of
rock, from which the spray had washed some of
the snow that covered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘It’s all up,’ he said, turning his eyes to the
great pile of loose rocks farther along the cliff;
‘they’re gone to <a id='clitt2'></a>clitter. Now, old fool, goest
home along.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a glance at the <a id='sea2'></a>sea, on which not a sail
or a wing showed, he made his way to the point
of the bluff above the mere, and letting himself
carefully over the edge, succeeded by clinging to
rock and tussock in making the descent without
mishap. At the foot he stood awhile to rest;
then, presently, set out across the snowfield for
the cottage, his thoughts full of the otter, which
however he had given up all hope of getting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So convinced was he that the creatures were
in the cliff that he attached no importance to the
trail he stumbled on in the midst of the mere, till
he came to the spot where the tracks forked; but
there he awoke to the significance of the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
‘Oh, oh,’ said he, as he checked his steps, ‘so
this was where you parted, was it?—one for the
reed-bed, t’other for up along, the withies most
like.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a pause he added with a chuckle, ‘Jack
oter, you’re mine yet.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the thought of the valuable prize falling to
him he was all life and energy again: the vigour of
his stride showed it as he stepped along the furrow
made by the otter, with eyes fixed on the isolated
clump near the inflow through which he expected
it would pass. His surprise and excitement may
be imagined when on reaching it and ringing it,
he found no sign of track on the snow beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Niver can be in this morsel of a patch,’ said
he under his breath, as he took up a station
between it and the reed-bed he felt sure the otter
would make for. ‘Yet eh must be, eh must be.’
Then, raising his voice, he called out, ‘King Oter,
thy time is come; show thyself and get the
business over.’ With that he began to beat
the reeds with the gun, trampling the stems as
he advanced. In the midst of the clump he
came on the couch. He stooped quickly and
felt that it was warm. ‘I knawed thee was
theere,’ said he; and crack, crack, crack went the
reeds as he levelled them with the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
Less than a dozen yards of cover remained
when the old man, in his anxiety to get a glimpse
of the otter, knelt down and peeped through the
stems. Only the head of the otter showed, but
the eyes of man and beast met. Before the
marshman could regain his feet, the creature
had bolted, making wild leaps in its attempt to
escape. Bang! bang! first one barrel, then the
other; and the old man, who believed he had
wounded the animal, started in mad pursuit.
For a few strides he actually gained on the short-legged
creature: but for want of breath he might
have overtaken it. As it was, all he could do
after covering a score yards was to lament his
helplessness, and watch the huge dark form draw
farther and farther away. ‘What a grand beast!’
he gasped again and again; then suddenly, ‘He’s
down!’ he exclaimed, starting to run. But the
otter was not down: not a pellet had struck him:
he was only lost to sight in a drift. When he
reappeared near the bar, the excited marshman
saw his error, and once more stood to watch.
On reaching the ridge the otter ran along it,
showing his magnificent proportions. Once he
stopped to look back at his enemy; a few
moments later he disappeared from view, and the
old man turned on his heel and made for home.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>BACK IN THE OLD HAUNTS</p>

<p class='pindent'>On passing out of the old man’s sight the otter
made for the cliffs, where he lay close, impatiently
awaiting nightfall that he might return to his
mate. The light had scarcely faded when he
took to the water. Early though it was to be
abroad, he had not got far before he espied her
swimming towards him, and presently he saw
that she held a cub in her mouth. The reports
of the gun had made her apprehensive for the
safety of her young, the tiniest of which she was
removing first to the <a id='clitt3'></a>clitter. The sea was rough
and the spindrift blinding, yet she held on with
her precious burden till she had reached a cave
behind the boulders and laid the dripping mite
in a nest there. Then she hurried back for
another; when that was placed beside the first
she fetched another, and yet another, till all four
were in safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as she had deposited the last she
assisted her mate to scour the sea-bed between
the cliffs and the Seal Rock in search of prey to
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
relieve her maddening hunger. For hours the
couple drew likely ground without result; but
when they were about to end their quest they
came on a stray pot containing a big crayfish.
The find was as welcome as it was unexpected.
In their eagerness to get at the prize the starving
creatures swarmed about the osier cage like
terriers about a rat-trap, vainly striving to find a
way between the bars or through the aperture at
the top, which was all but closed by the battering
the pot had received. It was a most tantalizing
situation. The otters’ only hope was to stay
near the cage until tide and ground-swell should
drive it ashore, dash it to pieces against the cliff,
and leave the crayfish at their mercy. So through
the long night they never left it except to breathe.
In the end their patience was rewarded. The
breakers got hold of the trap, tumbled it over
and over, and wedged it between two rocks,
smashing one of the bars, and making a hole
through which the female otter managed to
squeeze. In a twinkling she had seized the fish
and crushed its life out. As soon as the wave
which covered her withdrew, she began devouring
her prey. Whilst she feasted, the otter made
frantic efforts to get in, but failed, and presently
desisted, contenting himself with the bits that
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
escaped through the bars. The tide rose, yet the
little creature, despite the rush of the waters and
the blows she received from the stone that
weighted the pot, remained where she was until
she had consumed all except the feelers and
harder parts of the shell; then, leaving by the
way she had entered, she skirted reef and ledge
in the dawn-light, and made straight for the
clitter. Her one thought was for her famished
cubs, which, before the sun was very high, she
was suckling from her abundance, purring whilst
they fed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day a thaw set in, and a shag appeared
on the <a id='sealr2'></a>Seal Rock; The otter, who had shifted
his quarters to avoid the drippings from the
cliffs, after watching the bird’s fishing for a time,
began himself to fish. At the end of a long,
fruitless quest he landed; but now, in his extremity,
no longer careful for his safety, he lay
out in the open on a granite boulder. Happily no
harm came of it. Through the night he and his
mate hunted in the deep water beyond the rock,
still without seeing a fin, so that when the sun
peeped above the sea the creatures returned to
the cliffs in despair. At noon the mother brought
her puny little ones from the dank cave and laid
them in the sun’s rays to enjoy the genial warmth;
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
but as they soon cried to be fed, for fear their
plaints might betray them she carried them back
to the nest, and there, lulled by the sob of the
restless tide, she at length dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She might have slept for two hours when the
clamour of sea-fowl awakened her and brought
her in haste to the edge of the clitter, where the
otter was already on his feet gazing at a flock of
<a id='gull2'></a>gulls, whose excited movements showed they
were over fish. Whilst they looked the shoal
disappeared, and the gulls dispersed—like the
wonderful scouts they are—to watch for its return
to the surface. The instant the birds congregated
over an agitated patch of water between the
clitter and the Seal Rock the eager otters slipped
into the sea. Soon they were near enough to
distinguish the silvery spoil in the beaks of the
birds, and two minutes later they were in the
middle of the shoal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily the fish were sprats, so small that the
otters could eat them without landing, and if
the shoal had remained long on the surface the
animals would have filled themselves to repletion;
but before they had gobbled down a tithe of
what they needed the fish again sought the
depths. The otters pursued as far as breath
allowed, raising themselves in the water when
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
they came up, to look towards the direction the
fish had taken. Time after time they stood up
to gaze over the heaving surface, but with the
gathering of the dusk and the withdrawal of the
gulls to the cliffs they ceased, and landed on
the Seal Rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the few sprats had excited rather than
allayed their appetite, after a short rest they
began to fish again, little dreaming of the struggle
in which they were almost at once to be engaged.
For they had scarcely reached the bottom when
a tiny fish darted across an opening between two
clumps of weed; close behind, in pursuit of it,
came a big <a id='cong2'></a>conger. At once they took up the
chase of the pursuer where it followed its prey
from tangle to rock and from rock to tangle and
presently, when a sudden turn brought them
within striking distance of the unsuspecting fish,
they rose from beneath, careening over so as to
fasten on the fleshy throat. Their teeth had
scarcely met before the still depths were convulsed
by the writhings of the fish in its efforts
to shake off its assailants, who however hung on
till their victim grew quieter. Then, using their
tails and hind-feet, they raised their prey through
fathom after fathom until, for lack of breath, they
had to let go and come to the top. It was a few
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
seconds only before they were back again; but
the disabled fish made good use of the interval,
and had reached the mouth of the cave when they
overhauled it. They began anew to drag it
towards the surface. The monster writhed in
their grip, trying again and again to fold its tail
about some projecting rock past which it was
being lifted, but it failed to get a hold, and was
borne up, and up, and up, until the stars were just
visible through the water. Then the otters were
again compelled to let go and rise to breathe.
At the third attempt they barely held their own
against the fish, so violent was its resistance; at
the next, however, after a terrible struggle they
succeeded in getting it to the surface, where with
glowing eyes they lay and rested beside their
ghostlike prey before essaying to land it. Soon
they began towing it to the cliffs towards which
the tide had drifted them, but before they had
got far the conger, singling out the stronger
enemy, strove to coil itself about the otter. Failing
to get a grip of the slippery, lissom form, it
lashed the sea as if to vent its rage at its own
impotence. Then it took to shaking its head and
snapping its jaws. The otters however had it
helpless, and held grimly on their way till they
brought it to the edge of the breakers, where
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
from sheer exhaustion they let go, resting awhile
to recover a little strength before committing
themselves to the welter of the surf. Though
the fish too seemed to be at its last gasp, suddenly,
as if roused by the warning voice of the
breakers to a final effort, it shook itself free from
the otters, who had seized it as it stirred, and, with
a great swirl, disappeared beneath the surface.
Like a flash the otters were after it, but rose without
it once and again. The third time the fish
was between them. Almost immediately a wave
bigger than its fellows curled over them, buried
them in its mass of waters, and hurled them on
the sand, up which the otters dragged their prize
inch by inch till they had brought it to a wide
table of rock beyond reach of the surf. Although
out of the water, the conger still writhed until
the otter bit through its great backbone; then it
lay almost quiet whilst the starving creatures
sliced and munched and gulped as if they never
would be satisfied. Satiety however came at
last, and when they could eat no more they withdrew
to the clitter—night though it was—to
sleep off the orgy that marked the close of the
days of want.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the continuance of mild weather pollack
and plaice returned to the inshore waters, so that
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
soon, through the plentiful supply of food, the
otters regained their good condition, whilst the
cubs lost their emaciated appearance and throve
apace. From that time the ties that bound the
otter to his mate grew looser and looser, and a
week after the young had learnt to swim he left
her altogether, to resume his solitary life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while he kept to the <a id='head2'></a>headland and the
cliffs near the <a id='gullr2'></a>Gull Rock: then, tiring of these
haunts, he crossed to the wild coast opposite,
where he lingered week after week, until the
breath of spring quickened his roving instincts
and set him longing for the old trails. So he retraced
his steps from the point of the promontory
to which he had penetrated, and on the night of
the full moon drifted up the <a id='estu2'></a>estuary to <a id='tide1'></a>Tide End.
There, after fishing, he sought the shelter of a
pile of faggots before the villagers were astir.
He slept soundly, despite the near neighbourhood
of man, and when dusk fell swam past the
lighted cottages towards the wood. Landing
there and striking straight through the trees, he
held on without a stop till he reached the rude
wall at the upper end, on which he stood to listen
to the croakings proceeding from the marshy flat
beyond. Presently he stole towards the biggest
of the pools that silvered the rushy waste; but
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
when about midway he must have been heard or
seen, for the frogs there ceased their chorus, and
forthwith the marsh became as silent as when in
the grip of the frost. On gaining the water’s
edge he dived, and in a twinkling was back with
<a id='frog2'></a>a frog, which he skinned and devoured. This
was the first of some half a score that he caught
and ate before repairing to a ditch-like piece of
water, dark from the shadowing alders, where he
long remained feasting. At length he had had
enough and, leaving the marsh, made for the
river, which he followed mile after mile till he
reached the morass and laid up in the hollow
bank in which he was born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile otter-hunting had begun, and all
the country-side over men were on the lookout
for his tracks. Not since the mysterious disappearance
of the bob-tailed fox had so keen an
interest been taken in any wild creature. Through
the winter he had been the topic of conversation
in the chimney-corner of cotter and crofter, and
a very frequent intruder on the thoughts of the
squire. The slightest association was enough to
recall the creature to his mind: the sound of
running water, the appearance of a salmon-poacher
in court, even the sight of the short-legged
animal carved on the screen of the parish
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
church—indeed, his preoccupation showed itself
in many acts of his daily life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst the snow lasted he went every morning
to the pond to look for tracks, and as soon
as the first daffodils bloomed he began to dip his
hand in the streams to try their temperature,
longing for the time when the water would be
warm enough for the hounds to draw them. In
the meantime he busied himself with the various
duties of a <a id='master'></a>master of otter hounds. He visited
the kennels every day to make sure that the
hounds got road exercise to harden their feet.
He succeeded after much trouble in inducing the
keepers on neighbouring estates to remove the
traps which had been the bane of the Hunt. A
fortnight before the opening meet he rode round
to see the water-bailiff, the miller, the moorman,
old Ikey, and the marshman, asked them to keep
a lookout for the otter, and parted from each of
them with the words, ‘Now don’t forget, my
man. Morning, noon, or night, bring me word if
you strike his trail.’ It is not true, as alleged
by the gossips of the port, that he offered a
reward of ten pounds for information that should
lead to the finding and death of the otter, though
had there been an offer of twice that sum the
<a id='track1'></a>trackers could not have shown greater keenness
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
than they did. There was evidence of it even
before the search began, for every man from far
and near who meant to take a part turned up at
the hour fixed for the <a id='allot'></a>allotment of the waters,
determined to get his rights. This unusual procedure
had been adopted at the instance of the
squire, in order to avoid the disputes and bad
blood which he foresaw would arise unless the
beats were formally assigned before the season
opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='raft'></a>Raftra, in his ‘Annals of our Village,’ gives a
very full account of the meeting. It took place
at the <a id='druid2'></a>Druid’s Arms, with Reuben Gribble, the
<a id='land1'></a>landlord, in the chair. Between him and the
red-bearded water-bailiff sat the venerable tenant
of the Home Farm, called in ostensibly on account
of his wide knowledge of the streams, but really
because of his well-known powers of conciliation,
which were needed as soon as the business of the
evening began. The chief difficulty was with
Sandy, the bailiff, who claimed by virtue of his
office the whole length of the river, from <a id='tide2'></a>Tide
End to Lone Tarn. Though he was one against
a score, counting the men in the doorway, he
seemed bent on maintaining the unreasonable
position he had taken up. When the miller and
the moorman asked him for the reaches which
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
they preferred and which every man round the
table thought they were entitled to, he brushed
their requests aside as if they were nobodies. As
Raftra says, a Lord High Ranger couldn’t have
treated vagrom men with more contempt. This
haughty demeanour enraged everyone; in fact, it
was all Geordie and the wilder spirits could do to
keep their clenched fists off the bailiff’s person.
As it was, angry words passed, but when a fight
between the gipsy and the Scot seemed imminent,
the old <a id='reeve'></a>reeve rose, lifted his thin hands to
command silence, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Don’t quarrel, my friends—don’t quarrel;
better the otter never came anist us if it’s to lead
to blows. And yet, as an old tracker, it does my
heart good to see how eager every man of ’ee is
to get a good beat. For what else does it mean
but this, that the love of sport among us is as
strong as ever it was? It makes me long to be
one of ’ee, it do; to be young again, abroad at peep
o’ day, when the sun is touchin’ the cairns and
the wakin’ world is fresh and sweet, to feel once
more the joy of comin’ on the wild rover’s prents.
This minit in my mind’s eye I can see the five
round toe marks and the seal of the otter I
spurred beside the <a id='kieve2'></a>Kieve. You’ve heard of the
sport he gave. An old man’s tongue will run
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
away with him—run riot, I ought to call it. Your
indulgence, my friends, and your further patience
while I touch on the matter that brought me to
my feet. And let me say by way of preliminary
and to all alike, don’t be overreachin’; don’t,
simply to keep others out, claim more water than
you can search. “Live and let live” is a good
motto for a sportsman, be he Englishman or Scot;
and this I’m sure of, that my friend beside me
will look at things as a big-minded man always
do, and prove himself the good neighbour we’ve
taken him for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mr. Macpherson, we’ve treated ’ee like one of
ourselves since the coach dropped ’ee at the crossroads
now three year back; the more so, maybe,
since we’ve got to understand your mouthspeech.
True, there was a little soreness because Zachy
Kelynack didn’t get the job, but only for a month
or two; and we did our best to hide it, agreein’
among ourselves that if the <a id='duchy'></a>Duchy slighted our
own man, ’twas no fault of yourn, and no case
for pitchin’ and featherin’, or even for the pump.
Come to look back upon it, for a rough-and-ready
sort of people, whose parish is their world,
we met thee handsomely, though I say it, as I
hope we shall every strainyer who looks us
straight in the eyes and does his duty without
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
fear or favour. Now, is it askin’ ’ee too much to
show a friendly spirit in return and a little consideration
for local feelin’?’ Here the speaker
paused; but, as the <a id='bail2'></a>bailiff showed no sign of
giving in, he went on: ‘Come, come, Sandy, only
try and see the matter as we do. William Rechard
and Matthew Henry were born and reared upon
the moor, and have known the river all their
lives. Right or no right, do ’ee wonder they
think theirselves entitled to a reach or two? No,
you cannot, you do not. Be strong, my friend,
and give way.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, it was not so much what the old man
said as the way he said it that made the appeal
seem irresistible to all but the bailiff. And truly
the voice and manner of the speaker, mellow as
the rich light that flooded the low-raftered room,
would have gone home to men even less emotional
than his countrymen; but the dour Scot seemed
to be not the least affected till the landlord, who
had hurriedly disappeared through a side-door,
returned with a double-handled jug of old cider,
and by the influence of the seductive liquid
brought him to reason. At the fourth cup he
gave in with a good grace, yielding to the miller
the three miles of water above the mill. At the
sixth he granted the reach above Moor Pool to
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
the <a id='moorm2'></a>moorman, who also got the stream near his
cot; old Ikey got the Liddens, as was only fair,
since the pools were on his holding; the <a id='man4'></a>marshman,
the marsh; and the <a id='poach2'></a>poachers shared the
waters that remained, the order of choice being
decided by the length of straw, drawn from
the landlord’s closed hand. Geordie and Tom,
who as leaders of their profession had first and
second choice, to their chagrin got the shortest
straws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now for rivercraft or marshcraft the fourteen
men that daily gave at least an hour or two to the
search could not, perhaps, have been matched
outside that most ancient terrain of the otter-hunter,
the Principality of Wales. Yet though
the otter followed the usual trails over the moor,
the trackers never once came on a sign of him.
The reason is not far to seek. The beds of the
river and the streams are for the most part rocky,
the shallows and landing-places pebbly, and spits
of sand are few and far between. It was on
these last that the trackers relied to find the footprints,
and at dawn they might have been seen
bending over them, plying their craft as eagerly
as men seeking gold or precious stones. They
found nothing, for the otter had never set foot
there. Once, indeed, he left his tracks within a
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
bowshot of Moor Pool—tracks so plain that they
seemed to cry out; but before the bailiff reached
the spot the river rose and obliterated them, and
the bailiff never knew how near he had been to
discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the quest had gone on for nearly a
month, when men and squire were beginning to
fear that the otter had abandoned the district or
that his skin was adorning the bedroom floor of
some keeper who had trapped him, by the merest
chance the moorman happened on the prints near
the boundary of his little holding. He was struck
all of a heap, as he said, at the unexpected sight;
but on recovering himself he remembered the
squire’s words and the look in his eyes, so, though
the sun was only a few handbreaths above the
moor, he left the peat where he had dropped it
and set off at a brisk pace for the Big House. In
his excitement he forgot the hounds were out
until he reached the wood; but there, to the
amazement of the watching <a id='wood3'></a>woodman, who had
wondered at his haste, he suddenly turned, late
as it was, and made for the cross-roads, hoping
to intercept the squire and save himself a very
long journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By good luck the moorman reached the top of
the hill just in time to hail the squire as he rode
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
by, and ran down breathless to where he had
drawn rein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tracked un at laist, <a id='squire4'></a>squire,’ he gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Good news, Pearce. I’ve had a long day,
but I’ll go back with you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘It’s a brave way off, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No matter.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>So leaving the hounds to the whipper-in, he
accompanied the man to the moor, and examined
the tracks by the light of the lantern the moorman
had fetched from his cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘They’re his, right enough, Pearce. Funny
place to come on them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘’Tes and ’tesn’t, come to think of it, for I’ve
spurred otters on this very bit of ground more
than once before, and all goin’ the same way.
’Tes a line of traffic from the strame to the
revur.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah, that’s interesting. But, my word, what
amazing prints they are! What weight do you
put him at?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Afeerd to say, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘They’re a couple of days old, Pearce.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Iss, sir, all that, but you mind what you
told me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘All right, my man. I attach no blame; that’s
not my meaning.’</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
‘He’s alive and in the country, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, yes; to be sure he’s in the country.
Great thing to know that. It will hearten every
man of us. Great day, red-letter day when we
drop on him, eh, Pearce?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he rose to his feet, but was almost
immediately on his knees again for a last look.
At length he tore himself away, slipped a crown-piece
into the moorman’s hand, remounted, bade
the man good-night, and galloped off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the moorman on his way to stop the
squire had overtaken and told the post-woman:
the blacksmith at the cross-roads had overheard
what he said; and from these two the news spread
so rapidly and so far that before the morrow’s
sundown it was known through the country-side
that the otter had been tracked on Matthew
Henry’s splosh, that the squire had gone there
and seen the prints with his own eyes. To what
a pitch of excitement the <a id='track2'></a>trackers were aroused
by the tidings may be imagined. Most of them
were at the stream-side at the first glimmer of
day, and all of them remained out hours longer
than usual. The squire, expecting that word of
the otter might be brought at any moment,
feared to leave the house. He had even given
orders that Limpetty, the whipper-in, was to
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
have his meals at the kennels and to sleep in the
loft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the otter’s plans ran counter to the hopes
and expectations of his enemies. On the third
day after the discovery of his tracks he forsook
the moorland for the creek, where he feasted on
mussels and flounders till he tired of them. Then
he made down the estuary to the headland; he
robbed the <a id='tram'></a>trammels and spillers of the choicest
fish, and on one occasion actually took a bass
off a whiffing-line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus another month passed, by the end of
which the trackers who had stood so high in the
estimation of their neighbours began to be made
slight of, and even to be laughed at. Right
welcome to them were the heavy rains that
rendered river and streams unfit for hunting and
furnished a sound excuse for discontinuing the
hopeless quest. The flood was indeed a big one,
as the mark on the door of the miller’s stable
testifies. To this day the old men at the port
will tell you they never before knew the sea
stained to such a distance by the peaty water,
adding in the same breath that the run of fish
was ‘a sight to see.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harbour and estuary seemed alive as the
salmon made their way up the river: people
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
gathered at different spots to see them pass.
Villagers crowded the bridge at <a id='tide3'></a>Tide End where
the fish take the weir; Geordie and Tom stood at
the fall beneath the pines; the <a id='mill3'></a>miller, at the foot
of his garden, watched them go up the new
ladder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Bra run, Reuben,’ remarked he to the <a id='land2'></a>landlord
at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Iss, fy, and good fish among ’em. That’s a
heavy fish goin’ up now. He’ll do it; no, he
won’t, he an’t. That basin is like Malachi’s hen,
too high in the instep. I said it was when they
were puttin’ un in.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the miller took no notice, he bellowed in
his ear, ‘Custna hear what I’m sayin’, you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Hear! Of course I can; I’m not deef. Hear,
indeed! Thee wust drown the roar of a dozen
floods, thee wust! What have ’ee got to say?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Why, only this, that he’ll be up afore long.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What do ’ee mean by he?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What do I mean? What can a man mean
these days but one thing?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘How teasy you are.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Teasy, indeed! Do ’ee wonder at it? That
varmint has got on my nerves. I’m always
thinkin’ about un, I caan’t sleep for’n, and if I
do, I see un in my dreams. Most like he will
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
come up; and I hope and trust he will, and that
the hounds will find and kill un, or what’ll become
of the parish I don’t know. From the squire to
Tom Burn-the-Reed we’re gettin’ in a poor way,
and you the one man gettin’ any good out of it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the flood began to fall the otter did
come up, and the first night spent hour after hour,
to no purpose, chasing salmon in the pool below
the rapids. At dawn he climbed to the ivy-covered
branch of a tree overhanging the river,
to sleep as well as his uncomfortable quarters
allowed. That night he killed in the <a id='kieve3'></a>Kieve;
early in the morning the moorman disturbed a
pair of <a id='buzz4'></a>buzzards from the remains of his feast,
and tried to cross to look for tracks; but the
current was dangerous, and after being nearly
washed off his feet he turned back. The river
had not yet fallen to hunting level; but as soon
as it had, the bailiff, the miller and all the others
were out again, confident that the otter was up
and, despite previous failures, hopeful that they
would come on his track on one of the many new
sand-spits left by the receding waters.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>THE LONG TRAIL</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was ‘betwixt the lights,’ as he would have
said, when the miller closed the door quietly
behind him and made his way among the nut-bushes
to the ford where his search for the otter
usually began. No track marked the ground by
the water’s edge, nor was there a sign on any
of the likely spots all the way to the stranded
alder, where he sat to rest awhile before resuming
his beat. The pine-tops were then aglow and
the birds in full song, but they meant nothing to
him in the mood he was in; his thoughts, as his
words showed, were all for the otter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Not a trace. Pools full of fish, too, and
everythin’ as keenly as can be. Yet I’m sure
he’s up, and sartin he’ll be spurred afore the
day’s much older. Wonder who’ll be the lucky
man?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the thought of his rivals he sprang to his
feet and soon had reached the precipitous bank
above the shelving strand where, though so many
landing-places were undisturbed, he had every
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
hope of coming on the tracks. Most carefully
the eager eyes examined every foot of sand visible
between the rowan-trees as, slowly on hands and
knees, the <a id='mill4'></a>miller advanced towards the bend
which commands the likeliest spot of all. There
twenty feet below he saw a salmon lying and,
with the same glance, marked the tracks beside it.
The descent of the scarp was nearly as perilous as
the crossing of the current, but he accomplished
both without mishap, and a few seconds later
was crouching beside the footprints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘By the life of me they’re his, and not many
hours old.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face, no less than his agitated voice,
showed the wild excitement that possessed him
as he rose and made down the wood as fast as
he could lay foot to ground. When he reached
the mill he was almost at his last gasp, but he
bridled and mounted the pony, which he urged
to a gallop through the open gate and up the
stony lane. He was on his way to the squire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he rode through the hamlet, where the
clatter of the hoofs brought the villagers to door
and window, his cries of ‘Tracked un!’ roused
man and boy to a fever of excitement, and sent
the sexton in hot haste to the belfry to apprize
the country-side. The miller, however, leaving
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
them behind, was soon at the lodge gates. There
he nearly frightened old Jenny into hysterics by
his shouts; but she took her revenge, for after
letting him through she shook the keys in his
face and screamed after him, ‘Mad as a curley!
mad as a curley!’ until he rounded the bend
where the mansion comes into view. The whole
house seemed asleep; but as the miller crossed
the bridge over the moat the <a id='squire5'></a>squire appeared at
a window and, in a voice that betrayed the
tension of his feelings, called out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Where?’</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='long2'></a>‘Longen Pool, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Fresh?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Last night’s.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Rouse the men, Hicks; we shall need every
hand we can muster.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he had got through the plantation on
his way to the kennels the clang of the fire-alarm
broke on the still morning air, and when
he returned from his round, squire, whipper-in
and hounds were making their way through the
park with a small retinue of servants in their
train. At the hamlet they were joined by
the parson, the parish clerk, the landlord, two
sawyers, and six or seven others, and between
the pound and the river by a few crofters, whom
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
the church bell had summoned from outlying
homesteads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed the water below the pool, the
squire examined the tracks, the <a id='hound3'></a>hounds were laid
on, and the rocky gorge with all the wood about
it immediately resounded with their wild music,
while the squire and every man behind him
thrilled at the prospect of at last coming up with
the creature whose movements had so long
baffled them. The ground was very rough, and
in parts swampy, yet not a man turned back.
That active, hard-conditioned followers made
light of the obstacles and the pace was, of course,
not surprising; but that the landlord, the clerk,
and the chef—short-legged, eleven-score men
every one of them—should scramble over rocks
and fallen timber, flounder through thickets and
boggy places, and still hold on, bedraggled and
breathless though they were, testified to the
fascination the pursuit of the giant otter had for
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some two miles above Longen Pool the squire
caught sight of spraints on a boulder in the
middle of the river, and knew at once from their
position at its upper end that the otter which
had dropped them was travelling down-water.
At once he recalled the hounds and began drawing
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
anew the reaches he had passed. He tried
every holt he came to, but without result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do you think he’s gone down?’ shouted the
squire to the miller across the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I don’t, sir. I didn’t find a trace from the
ford up, and, as you know, the hounds didn’t
give a sign.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, there’s no holding worth the name
between here and Longen. Where can he be?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The puzzling question was answered by the
deep note of Dosmary from an overgrown watercourse
that served to drain the morass. No need
was there for the squire to cry out, ‘Hark to
Dosmary’; for the hounds, on hearing the summons
they knew so well, flew to her where she
threaded the reed-bed before taking the steep
leading to the moor. Then up the all but bare
face the twenty couple made their way in a long
winding line. Close after the hindmost pressed
the squire, the parson and five others, all sound
of wind and limb, capable of holding on to the
end of the promontory, if need be. Not a word
passed until the hounds had crossed the stream
where it was thought the otter might have laid
up, and then only <a id='lidd3'></a>‘Liddens, men,’ and ‘Ay, sir!’
from the <a id='moorm3'></a>moorman in response. Even the sight
of the otter’s footprints in the next hollow drew
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
no remark; though it caused an unconscious
quickening of the step up the long, heathery
slope, from whose brow the sea showed beyond
the hazy outline of the land. Wide on either
hand rose grim piles of rock, where down this
avenue of cairns the seven, comrades on many a
trail, sped in the wake of the pack towards the
Liddens, shimmering in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the seven were elated as never before,
there was one on the far side of the moor who
was suffering a bitter disappointment. It was
the old marshman. He too had discovered the
tracks of the otter and, full of his tidings, had
driven to the mansion as fast as his Neddy could
cover the ground, only to learn from the butler
that squire and hounds had already been summoned
and gone off to the river. Staggering
though the blow was, he bore up till beyond
the gates; but on the open moor he broke down,
said it was a judgment on him for tracking the
varmint in the snow, and let the donkey find the
way home as best it could. When they reached
the cottage he set the animal loose, tried in
vain to shake off his trouble by overhauling the
trimmers, and finally sat down on a bench, with
his back to the mud wall and his face to the
marsh. It was green and gold with the swords
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
and banners of the iris; the air was drowsy with
the hum of bees and the sea murmured on the
bar; yet the old man noted nothing of it. His
thoughts, too, were all of the otter; he was busy
trying to reconcile the seemingly contradictory
discovery of the tracks in two places so far apart.
‘’Tes a job to piece ’em together with leagues—iss,
leagues—of moor between. Why, look here.
’Tes all eight miles from the revur to the Liddens,
and a good three as the hern flies from the
Liddens to the ma’sh; <a id='trail2'></a>a long journey, an unaccountable
long journey for a crittur that edn
framed for travellin’. On a midsummer night,
too, and he more afeard of the glim o’ day than a
cheeld of the dark. And then to turn his back
on the salmin for the pike, and they poor as can
be from spawnin’. Why, the thing edn in reason.
But, theere, what’s the use of wastin’ breeth
when he’s done it? For the prents are hisn and
none other, and nawthin’ could be fresher.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marshman was right: the otter had crossed.
At star-peep the creature had slipped from his
holt in the side-stream and floated down to <a id='pool4'></a>Moor
Pool, where he killed a grilse, took a slice or two
from its shoulder, and left it on the pebbles.
Thence, contrary to his habit, he passed down-water,
throwing the fish into a panic at every
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
pool. Waves in the shallows showed where the
most timid fled at his approach; some however
remained and here and there, as the water
favoured his purpose, he gave chase. Twice the
formidable marauder landed with victims which
he left uneaten on the bank where he laid them,
for lust of slaughter, not hunger or love of pursuit,
possessed him, and he was moved by a restlessness
greater than he had ever shown. True, he
climbed at times on snag and boulder; but that
was only for an instant before taking again to the
water or bank, as fancy led.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Longen Pool his coming caused a general
exodus, but he singled out one <a id='salm3'></a>salmon, and by
his wily tactics prevented it from fleeing with
the others to the rapids below. The long chase
which followed was for a while in favour of the
fish; yet the otter, who was not to be denied, in
the end wearied it out and carried it to the bank,
where he bit viciously at the shoulder, as if to
wreak his vengeance on the prey that had caused
him so much trouble. Presently he re-entered
the water, cleansed his blood-stained muzzle, and
making upstream turned aside into the wet ditch
and traversed the morass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On gaining the high ground above it he stood
awhile, as if asking himself whether at the late
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
hour he might venture across the moor. The
instant his mind was made up he set out at a rapid
pace, glancing at the keeper’s lodge as he went
by, and again at the sleeping hamlet before crossing
the road and entering on the waste, over
which he held on his way till nearly abreast of
the cromlech. There he halted whilst he sounded
the call and listened. Twice he uttered the
shrill cry, his mask turned in the direction of the
lone pool to the north; but there was no answer
in the mocking whistle of the <a id='curl2'></a>curlew, so he
moved on again under the fading stars, and at
last came to the Liddens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept awhile to the open water, cruising
restlessly about, as he had done before in the
creek and mere, raising himself at times and gazing
round, as wild a looking creature as imagination
can conjure up. Thence he passed into the thick
fringe of reeds, and remained hidden so long that
it might be thought that he had laid up there.
Later however he appeared on the far bank of
the westernmost pool, and though the pale primrose
streak in the east warned him of coming
day, the outlawed animal, alarmed by the taint
of human footprints he had happened on, at
once forsook the refuge and set his face for the
<a id='marsh4'></a>marsh.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
His hurried movements showed that he had
full knowledge of the risk he ran in the open,
where he looked a monster as he crossed the
patches of sward amongst the bilberry. Indeed,
so fast did he cover the ground that no sprinter
could have kept up with him, especially when he
breasted the long, boulder-strewn ascent to the
Kites’ Cairn. There old Ikey must have viewed
him had he been on his way to the pools at his
usual hour; but he was late, and soon the otter
was amongst the crags. His feet were here
delayed momentarily by the rising sun, whose
light he dreaded as much as did the witches of
Crowz-an-Wra. But there was no staying where
he was: he must press on to marsh or sea, now
both in his view; and at panic speed he made his
way down the bare slope and up the opposite
rise to the great furze brake that runs down
almost to the margin of the mere. Leisurely he
threaded his way through the close cover to a
point where he stood and listened to the crowing
of a cock before slipping into the water and
crossing to the old hover on the edge of the reed-bed.
He made his careful toilet as usual, and
before the marshman discovered his tracks he
had curled up and fallen asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whilst the otter slept in untroubled
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
security, heedless of his enemies, they had passed
the Liddens and come within earshot of the old
man, who had scarcely finished his soliloquy
when he started to his feet with the exclamation,
‘What’s that?’ and stood listening as intently as
the otter a little earlier had listened for a reply to
his call. This time, however, the reply came.
‘Surely theere ’tes again,’ and a few seconds later,
as the cry rose afresh, he shouted ‘’Tes they’ so
loudly that he attracted the child who joined
him on the furze-rick he had hurriedly climbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do ’ee hear them, Mary? ’Tes the hounds.
Hark! cheeld.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I hear something, granfer.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Wheere do ’ee make the cry to come from?’
and for answer she pointed with her free hand to
the Kites’ Cairn. ‘Now keep an eye on the
rocks, and tell me if you see anythin’.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There’s something streaming through the
<a id='fairy'></a>Fairies’ Gap this minit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now it’s like a
shadow, a moving shadow on the down.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
They’re dogs. My word, such a passel of them,
all in a bunch!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they passed from sight and the weird cry
almost died away; but presently the chorus
swelled, and swelled, and swelled, and then the
old man saw the hounds, like maddened things,
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
come pouring over the brow and enter the brake
full in his view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You’re tremblin’, granfer.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Iss, cheeld, all of a quake, like the yallow
furze where the hounds are forcin’ a way. The
moosic is ’most too much for me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mary,’ said he, and the child raised her wondering
eyes to the excited face, ‘’tes the line of
the King Oter they’re spakin’ to, and—who can
tell?—maybe the sun will shut down on a great
day. But, lor me! what am I doin’ here on this
rick, with hounds about to take the water? My
place is in the <span class='it'>Mary Jane</span>.’ With that he
scrambled down the rude ladder and bustled
towards the spot where he had left the boat in
the early morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he stepped in, the pack, which had
been almost mute since entering the mere, broke
out into a babel of music, proclaiming a find.
The uproar so unnerved him that he was long in
getting the oars between the thole-pins; but
when he did, he pulled with might and main till,
drawing near the hounds, he stopped rowing and
kept a sharp lookout for the quarry repeating
as he scanned the water: ‘Ef ’tes only he, only
he.’ But not a sign of otter, big or small, met
his eyes, either in the mere or in the creek, to
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
which the chase presently shifted. There the fear
that the game would land and reach the cliff
suddenly possessed him. So all at once he urged
the <a id='boat3'></a>boat past hounds and island to the reedy
corner, where he jumped to his feet and kept
splashing the water to drive the otter back. The
nearer the hounds approached the more frantically
he wielded the oar, nor did he desist till they
showed by their movements that the otter had
left the end of the creek and was returning to
the mere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst he watched them the squire and his
followers came over the brow, and all made for
the beach except the squire, who came tearing
down the hill towards the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘To the hounds, John!’ he gasped as he stepped
into the crazy craft. At the word the old man
pushed off and bent to his work with wondrous
vigour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Have you viewed the otter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, sir, I haven’t, but I spurred un.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You spurred him? When?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Soon aifter break o’ day.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You did?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Iss, sir, sure as you’re standin’ on they starn
sheets.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What! the big otter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
‘Iss, sir. The <a id='king'></a>King Oter, I call him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then why didn’t you bring word?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I did, sir, fast as I could, but you’d gone off
to the revur. ’Twas Mr. Pugmore as told me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I see, I see! Pull with your right, or we
shall be into the island. That will do; now both
together.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Wind him, my lads! middy ho, wind him!
Padzepaw, Troubadour, Rowtor, wind him!
Wind him, my lads!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheery cry seemed to put fresh life into
the hounds as they worked the reeds, from which
they presently drove the quarry to the mere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The squire’s keen eyes searched the glittering
surface to get a glimpse of him, but in vain; the
hounds might have been giving tongue to some
phantom quarry for all that he or the old man
saw. And so the chase continued for an hour,
and another and another, whilst the otter led the
pack from reed-bed to reed-bed, where he rose
and vented without exposing himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the marshman, who at the moment
was resting on the oars, pointed to the surface
beneath the right blade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The chain, the chain!’ whispered the squire
excitedly on sighting the string of bubbles, and
‘There he vents!’ as the nose of the quarry showed
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
between two lily-leaves a few yards off. The
otter remained where he was until the hounds
were almost upon him; then he sank as noiselessly
as he had risen, and made for another refuge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You viewed him, sir?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I viewed an otter, John.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then why didn’t ’ee tally him, sir?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Because I’m not sure it’s him. I don’t want
to raise false hopes in all these people.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>For by this time many had arrived, some by
boat, others in vehicles, some on horses or
donkeys, and had taken up stations round the
mere. There were at least a score on the point,
as many near the inflow: there was a tall thin
man who had somehow found his way to the
edge of the reed-bed, and quite a little crowd on
the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Never see’d such a passel o’ people here since
the wreck of the <span class='it'>Triton</span>, and that was afore your
time, sir. The casks of rum were all over the
beach, and men, too; and as for the cocoanuts,
they were .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ The outstretched hand of the
squire silenced him, for the otter had risen within
a few yards of the boat, and lay there showing
its great length. Both were tongue-tied by the
sight, but no sooner did the otter dive than the
squire gave utterance to a ‘Tally-ho!’ the like of
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
which had never passed his lips before. It made
the marshman jump: it sent a thrill through the
cordon of spectators: it made the child hurry
again to the furze-rick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Did you see him?’ asked the squire excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I did, and I don’t wonder it fetched such a
screech out of ’ee. Lor, maister, ’twere enow to
wake the dead.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two minutes later the otter was ‘gazed’ by the
men on the point. Soon after a shout came from
Geordie at the end of the creek,—so soon that
the squire feared there must be two otters afloat.
But he was wrong: there was only one. Next
the people on the bar saw him rise, with the
hounds close behind driving him towards the
reed-bed, where he landed within a dozen yards
of the solitary figure there. To him it looked as
if the otter must be overhauled, and eagerly he
watched the swaying of the reeds as otter and
hounds traversed the bed. Soon, in view of the
excited crowd near the inflow, the hunted beast
managed to slip into the mere as a hound was
about to seize him. Four times he rose in crossing
to the farther shore, where he threaded the
sags and, in his desperation, sought the refuge of
the furze-brake. The cover was all in his favour;
for he could run where the hounds, and even the
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
terriers, had to force a way. Yet to him as to
them the atmosphere was suffocating, so that he
was glad to reach the upper edge and get a few
breaths of fresh air before the clamour of the
hounds and the crackling of the stems warned
him it was time to move. Then he made his
way down to the creek to quench his thirst. The
parson, by this time perched on the willow, saw
him lapping, but forbore to shout, and presently
the dark mask was withdrawn. Soon the hounds
reached the spot. Thirsty though they were,
they thirsted still more for the otter’s blood.
Not one stayed to lap but, like infuriated creatures,
went on after the quarry whose distress
they must have been conscious of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before this the crowd from the bar had moved
to the bluff above the creek, whence they could
trace the windings of the otter by the movements
of the hounds. Breathless was their excitement
when they saw from the wild shaking of the
bushes that the otter had been seized, and great
their disappointment when the resumption of
the chase showed that, after all, he had got
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice more the gallant beast made the wide
circuit of those ten acres of furze in the hope of
shaking off his pursuers before he made his way
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
in despair down to the sags and slipped unseen
into the mere. He rose after but a short dive,
and swam with the pack in his wake straight for
the bar. Not one of those who watched dreamt
he would dare to land; but he did, a good score
yards in front of the leading hounds. Then all
could see his distress as he laboured over the
pebbly ridge he knew so well. It looked as if he
must be overtaken before he reached the tide;
but the hounds were nearly as exhausted as he,
and though they gained on him, it was not until
they came to the calm water beyond the breaking
wave that they managed to hold him and worry
his life out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the squire waded into the sea almost to
his armpits, took him from the hounds, and holding
the heavy carcass above his head, brought it
ashore. The ‘field’ closed round him in their
eagerness to see and touch the beast and examine
the huge pads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A little elbow-room, gentlemen, if you please.
I can’t possibly weigh the animal whilst you
press me like this.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words had instant effect. The moment
the crowd fell back he suspended the otter from
the hook of the spring-balance he carried, and
watched the index.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
‘What does he scale, sir?’ shouted a score
excited voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Twenty-nine pounds good.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then followed a tumult of conversation, amidst
which could be distinguished:</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now, Thomas ’Enery, what did I say all
along?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘He’s a pound over and above your guess.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sandy was right.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You said forty pound, Geordie, you know
you did.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You’m a liard; I——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Silence, mates!’ <a id='land3'></a>roared the landlord, stepping
into the ring; ‘the squire wants to spake. Silence,
I say!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the noisy groups of disputants at last
quieted down, the squire, hoarse from his efforts,
said: ‘It is my custom, as you know, to distribute
the pads, mask and rudder, and fling the carcass to
the hounds. To-day, however, I mean to depart
from the rule. I will tell you why, and I hope
every one of you will agree that I am right. My
view is that this fine beast’—and here he lifted
the otter clear of the sand as if to emphasize his
words—‘which has excited so much interest and
afforded a hunt we can never expect to see the
like of, ought not to be broken up, but should be
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
preserved for ourselves and others to look at in
the years to come. Now, if any man has got
anything to say, let him speak out.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Say, sir,’ replied the parish clerk, after casting
his quick eyes round the circle of approving faces,
‘why, that we’re one and all of the same way of
thinkin’ as yoursel’! What’s a pad here or a pad
there? To say nawthin’ as to who’s to have ’em.
By all manner o’ means let the otter be set up,
and let un be given pride of place again’ the
wainscot; for if ever wild crittur deserved the
honour, this one do, if only for the good he’s done
the landlord.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the otter was set up in the hall in a handsome
case, with a picture of the marsh for background.
Of the many trophies that adorn the
walls there is not one the squire was so proud of,
none whose story he liked so well to relate. It
alone bears no inscription; for, as he always said,
‘There is no need; my people will never let the
record die!’ His words have proved true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the wild promontory is steeped in
legend and romance, though tales of giants, fairies,
smugglers and shipwrecked sailors, abound, there
is no story the crofters so often repeat by the
firelight as the story of the otter, none the
children listen to with closer attention. Mary’s
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
three boys never wearied of hearing their mother
tell how she stood on the rick and watched the
hounds stream through the Fairies’ Gap; they
always insisted on her giving the squire’s ‘Tally-ho!’
and hung on every word when she came to
the message brought by the steward, that old
John and his grandchild were to have their little
place rent free for the rest of their days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Again, again!’ they would cry, clapping their
little hands; and generally Mary yielded to their
entreaties. And when the time comes they will
repeat the tale to their own children, as indeed
do the miller’s and the moorman’s sons and
daughters to-day. Thus the tradition of the otter
bids fair to be handed on by generation after
generation for long years to come, and to win
an imperishable place amongst the hearthside
stories of the West.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
